we are the first to exploit this similarity directly. The adoption of CGs offers
several advantages. Their structure is straightforward to obtain [6]. Moreover,
unlike other binary graph representations, a CG represents the program at a
higher level of abstraction. This makes it a compact yet information-rich program
representation, which is particularly well-suited for a GMN [18].
