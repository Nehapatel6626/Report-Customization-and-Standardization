In the context of TACA, CÂ´amara et al. (2020) developed a method for finding optimal task and
reconfiguration plans for an autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) navigating in a graph-like environment.
To enable optimal planning within reasonable time limits, their method first reduces the search space by
finding all possible reconfiguration plans and then computing the shortest N paths the robot can take to
reach its goal. Then, it uses this information along with task-specific models that capture mission quality
attributes (e.g., energy consumption, collision probabilities) and a preferred utility to apply model checking
and determine an optimal reconfiguration plan for each path. Finally, an optimization function selects the
best plan based on a predefined utility function (e.g., minimizing energy consumption, time, or collision
probability). Although their approach reduces the planning search space to improve planning time, their
experiments show that solving the navigation use case still takes an average of 15.1 seconds, an impractical
duration for robots that frequently need to replan at runtime to handle uncertainties. Additionally, while
the approach is model-based, it relies on task-specific model transformations (e.g., converting the map or
battery model into PRISM model snippets), which require dedicated implementations for different tasks.
This limits the reusability of their approach for different types of tasks, as it requires a considerable amount
of development effort.
