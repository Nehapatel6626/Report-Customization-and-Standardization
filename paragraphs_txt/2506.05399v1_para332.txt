The work of [3] introduced a new Vietnamese image cap-
tioning method. This method comprises an image captioning
model, an English-Vietnamese translation model, and an un-

decoder, RNN. Additionally, the model provides an unknown
word processing module to address the problem of unknown
words in Vietnamese translation.
