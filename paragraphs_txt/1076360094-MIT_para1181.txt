Figure 7-1: Diagram of the adapt system. 1) Input data Sreceived sent through the
decision system to produce predicted labels Yreceived and probabilities probablities .
2) Samples are selected in using probabilities Preceived 3) The selected data Sselected
is split into Strain and Stune 4) The training data Strain is split into Sprimary used to
train the update the primary classiﬁers and Ssecondary used to update the secondary
classiﬁers 5) The tuning data Stune is used to Tune the decision system
