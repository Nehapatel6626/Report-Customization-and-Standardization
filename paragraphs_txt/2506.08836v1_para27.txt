scribed recordings of the Bernese parliament "Grosser Rat". The data is divided
into a training set of 293 hours and a test set of 6 hours. Since the parliament is
located in Bern, most speakers use a Bernese dialect. The annotations are not
entirely accurate transcriptions. The duration of the samples varies from 0.1 s to
108 s, with an average duration of 7.1 s.
