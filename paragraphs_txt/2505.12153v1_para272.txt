The most significant accuracy degradation is observed under
high heterogeneity and noise, indicating a compounding effect.
Surface irregularities also suggest the influence of additional
factors, such as training stochasticity, model architecture, and
hyperparameters. Within the FDRL framework for RAS, these
findings highlight
the need to mitigate data heterogeneity
across hospitals and carefully calibrate privacy mechanisms to
