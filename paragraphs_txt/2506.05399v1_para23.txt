are limited. In retrieval-based systems, captions are retrieved
from a set of existing captions. This approach has the advan-
tage of generating generic and syntactically correct captions.
However, it may not produce semantically accurate captions
specific to the image. Both template-based and retrieval-based
approaches are not flexible enough, as they rely on existing cap-
tions in the training set or hard-coded language structures [2].
