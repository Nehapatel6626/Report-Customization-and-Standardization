History of AI
The birth of AI (1943 â€“ 1956)
Pitts and McCulloch (1943): simplified mathematical model of neurons (resting/firing states) can realize all propositional logic primitives (can compute all Turing computable functions)
Allen Turing: Turing machine and Turing test (1950)
Claude Shannon: information theory; early game theory, possibility of chess playing computers
Tracing back to Boole, Aristotle, Euclid (logics, syllogisms, algebra of symbols)
