Bottom-up parsing is data directed
The initial goal list of a bottom-up parser is the string to be parsed. If a sequence in the goal list matches the RHS of a rule, then this sequence may be replaced by the LHS of the rule.
Parsing is finished when the goal list contains just the start category.
If the RHS of several rules match the goal list, then there is a choice of which rule to apply (search problem)
Can use depth-first or breadth-first search, and goal ordering.
The standard presentation is as shift-reduce parsing.
