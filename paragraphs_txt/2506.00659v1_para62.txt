Requirement 3 - Dynamic Evasive Behavior Management. It must effec-
tively handle evasive behaviors encountered during the collection of wild samples
for integration. Wild samples may employ dynamic evasion techniques or be so
damaged or corrupted that execution is impossible [35], thereby complicating
dynamic signature extraction performed by state-of-the-art tools [16]. To ad-
dress this challenge, a static analysis-based approach can mitigate these issues
by extracting valuable information and artifacts independently of execution.
