based Image Description Evaluation (CIDEr) metric to assess
the similarity of a generated sentence to a set of human-authored
ground truth sentences [127]. It employs a Term Frequency-
Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting for each n-
gram in the candidate phrase to encode their frequency in the
reference sentences. This metric evaluates the grammar, rele-
vance, and accuracy.
