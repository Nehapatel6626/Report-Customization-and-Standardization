Park et al. (2012) introduced the SHAGE framework for task-based and resource-aware architecture
adaptation in robotic systems. SHAGE partially solves TACA, as it can adapt the robot’s architecture at
runtime to specifically realize each action in its task plan when it needs to be performed. However, SHAGE
does not support task execution adaptation based on the robot’s architectural state. SHAGE promotes
reusability by leveraging architectural models and knowledge captured with an ontology to reason about
adaptation at runtime. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no implementation of the SHAGE
framework that works with common robotic frameworks. Thus, it is not possible to directly reuse SHAGE.
