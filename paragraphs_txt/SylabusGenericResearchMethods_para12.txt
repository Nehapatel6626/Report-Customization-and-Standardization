This course will prepare you to make independent contributions to the discipline of geography by designing, conducting, and communicating the results of your own research. We take a scientific approach to the discipline from which we will go over topics such as: 1) The Scientific Method, 2) History and philosophical systems of the discipline of Geography: Natural Science, Social Science, and the Humanities, 3) Fundamental research concepts such as theory, empiricism, and scale, 4) Data collection and measurement, 5) Design of Analysis and Design of Experiments, 6) Sampling and statistical data analysis, 7) Data display and geo-visualization, 8) Reliability and validity, 9) GIScience and GISystems, 10) Scientific writing and communication, and 11) Ethics in Research. Throughout the course you will be conducting your own literature review and sharing it with the class. In addition to simply being a great way to inform yourself of a subject area, a literature review is also a means by which you make sure that whatever research you choose to embark on has not been done before and is informed by what others have already explored and communicated to the broader community. In addition you will prepare a research proposal as both a powerpoint presentation and as a written document. Ideally this research proposal will be your actual proposal for your graduate degree but this is not absolutely required.
