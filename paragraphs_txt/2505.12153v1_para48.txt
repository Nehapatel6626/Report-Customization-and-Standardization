A detailed summary of the parameters and notation used
throughout this study is provided in Table I, ensuring clarity
and consistency in defining key mathematical formulations
and system components. One of the exciting opportunities
that FL offers in this domain is the ability to train mul-
tiple policies (i.e., different RL models) that specialize in
different surgical contexts or conditions. For example, one
policy might be particularly good for handling minimally
invasive surgery while another might be better suited for open
surgery or tissue repair. Another policy could specialize in
robotic-assisted precision surgeries. The global model, which
combines knowledge from all hospitals, can then intelligently
select and apply the appropriate policy depending on the
context of the current surgery (e.g., the type of procedure being
performed, the patientâ€™s condition, or the tools available).
