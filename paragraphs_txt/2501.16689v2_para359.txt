During the transition, the protocol maintains atomic opera-
tions. The validation agent tracks changes across all state
dimensions, ensuring partial updates cannot create incon-
sistent states. If the temporal agent approves a ﬂight time
but the resource agent ﬁnds insufﬁcient seats, the entire
transition fails and rolls back.
