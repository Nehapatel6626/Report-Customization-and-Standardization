A distributed system is a collection of entities, each of which is autonomous, programmable, asynchronous and failure-prone, and which communicate through an unreliable communication medium.
Entity=a process on a device (PC, PDA)
Communication Medium=Wired or wireless network
Our interest in distributed systems involves 
design and implementation, maintenance, algorithmics
