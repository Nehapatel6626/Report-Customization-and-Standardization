The revision process of an initial domain theory works by performing a set of modifications on it, in order to obtain a correct revised theory. The modifications performed on a theory are the result of applying revision operators that make small syntactic changes on it. A correct revised theory that is obtained through a minimal modification of the initial theory is achieved by minimizing the number of operations performed. By requiring minimal modification, we mean that the initial theory is assumed to be approximately correct, and therefore the revised theory should be as semantically and syntactically similar to it as possible.
