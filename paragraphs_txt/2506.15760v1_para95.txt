Unlike using symbolic manipulation to solve problems, as we usually see in calculus, nu- 
merical algorithms use approximation to find solutions. This is especially useful in solving 
engineering problems, as well as solving problems in physics, life science, medicine, finan- 
cial, and aerospace. Traditional error analysis on numerical algorithms focuses mostly on
