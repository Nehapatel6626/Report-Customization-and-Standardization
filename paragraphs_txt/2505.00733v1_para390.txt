During the mission execution, the AUV was able to overcome all uncertainties: adapting to thruster
failures (U1) with structural adaptation, to changing water visibility (U2) with parameter adaptation, and to
an unexpected drop in the battery level (U3) with TACA, demonstrating the feasibility of using ROSA to
enable runtime TACA in ROS 2-based robotic systems.
