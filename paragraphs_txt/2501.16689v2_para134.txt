Agent Repository Component This component main-
tains a distributed collection of planning agents, each de-
signed with a restricted context window and specialized
interface. By dividing cognitive tasks among agents, the
repository ensures a complete representation of constraints
without overwhelming individual components. The meta-
planner queries this repository to select agents for speciÔ¨Åc
roles and dependencies based on task requirements.
