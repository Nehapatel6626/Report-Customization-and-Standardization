In formal systems, consistency proofs require a “higher-
order” system. Analogously, MACI provides a validation
framework that operates as a higher-order metasystem for
LLM output. By decoupling planning from validation,
MACI mirrors the separation needed in formal systems,
where validation is performed independently to avoid con-
ﬂicts and errors.
