To evaluate ROSAâ€™s performance, the SUAVE exemplar was configured with the same parameters as
described in the SUAVE paper (Silva et al., 2023). In addition, for the extended use case, the battery was
set to discharge within 200 seconds, and the search pipeline and inspect pipeline actions were set to require
at least 25% of battery to be performed.
