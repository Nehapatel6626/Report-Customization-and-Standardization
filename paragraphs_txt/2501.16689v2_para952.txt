None of the LLMs cannot react appropriately to this new
event without clearing their context buffers. As explained
in Appendix E.8.2, this limitation is evident. The key take-
away is that for future runtime frameworks, we must ensure
infrastructure support for selectively invalidating stale con-
straints. If a workï¬‚ow is already in execution, completed
steps and assignments cannot be erased or altered. For ex-
ample, in a stock-market investment plan, when pertinent
news arrives, MP cannot revert completed nodes or re-
solved dependencies in WR. For now, we treat the reactive
plan as a new plan, given that no steps have been realized
in the real world by 10:00 AM.
