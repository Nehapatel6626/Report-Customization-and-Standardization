Behavior trees: To enable task decision-making and execution with BTs in combination with ROSA,
the BTs must consider the runtime feasibility of performing the robot’s actions as inferred by the KB
component. This work proposes adding before action nodes a condition node that queries the KB to ask
whether the following action is feasible. The proposed pattern is depicted in Figure 5, where the action
MyAction would only be executed when its status in the KB is not ‘unfeasible’.
