Rosenblatt developed the perceptron learning algorithm, 
which uses y = sign(wTx) in the output node to perform 
multivariate binary linear classification. If the classes 
are linearly separable, as in Boolean AND below, PLA finds a boundary in attribute space that separates members from non-members.
