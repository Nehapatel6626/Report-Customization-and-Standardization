The agent repository in MACI serves as a structured
database, enabling efﬁcient registration,
retrieval, and
matching of agents to task requirements. By categoriz-
ing agents into common agents and specialized agents,
the repository supports both generalized functionality and
domain-speciﬁc expertise, as outlined in Section 4.1.
