Fig. 2. Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning Architecture for Privacy-
Preserving Robotic-Assisted Surgery. The framework illustrates a multi-
layered workflow comprising local RLtraining at distributed hospitals usingDP
and HE, secure aggregation at the federated aggregator, and optimal surgical
policy selection at the robotic decision layer using a MSS.
