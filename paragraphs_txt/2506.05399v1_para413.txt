In the English Flickr8k dataset, the method described in
[68] achieved a high BLEU-1 score of 0.690, giving a strong
performance in generating relevant captions. However, with
the Arabic Flickr8k dataset, the method in [64] only achieved
a BLEU-1 score of 0.598, revealing the challenges of adapt-
ing methods to different languages and contexts. Additionally,
when the method described in [88] was applied to the Bengali
Flickr8k dataset, it produced lower scores, with many values
marked as ’NA,’ suggesting that all metrics did not evaluate the
approach.
