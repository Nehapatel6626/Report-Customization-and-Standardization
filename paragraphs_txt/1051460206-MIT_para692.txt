aberrations,  focus,  lighting, contrast,  etc.  The microscope  system is composed  of an optical
resolution and a digital resolution.  Whichever  of these  two resolutions  is lower limits the
resolution of the entire  microscope  system.  Table 3  summarizes  the theoretical  optical  and digital
resolutions  achieved  with the AutoScope imaging  system.  We  show the  process  of deriving  these
resolutions  across  the next two  sections.
