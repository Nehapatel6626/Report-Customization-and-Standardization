The  motivation  of this  experiment  is to validate  the end-to-end  performance  of the
AutoScope  system  in detecting  RBCs  and WBCs in urine.  We  will accomplish  this by producing
synthetic  urine with different  concentrations  of urine particles.  Then,  we will use  our automated
urinalysis  system  to measure the  concentration  of urine particles  in these  solutions.  We will
compare  our system's results  with the reference  results,  and  quantify how well they correlate.
