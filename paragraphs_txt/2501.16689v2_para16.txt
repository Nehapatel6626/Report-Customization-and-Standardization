2. Attention Bias and Constraint Drift.
In complex sce-
narios, LLMs demonstrate a critical cognitive limitation
known as cognitive tunneling. This phenomenon occurs
when recently provided context dominates and progres-
sively erodes earlier-established constraints. When plan-
ning a multi-leg journey, for instance, an LLM might opti-
mize the Ô¨Ånal travel segment while completely neglecting
crucial earlier constraints such as vehicle availability or re-
quired rest periods. This bias toward local optimization fun-
damentally undermines the global feasibility of generated
plans.
