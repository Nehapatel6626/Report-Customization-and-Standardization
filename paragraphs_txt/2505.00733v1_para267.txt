The KB component consists of the TypeDB implementation of the proposed knowledge model and
inference rules, the ROS interfaces for communicating with the MAPE components, and the logic to
manage ROSA’s knowledge which is stored in a TypeDB database. In this reference ROSA implementation,
TypeDB’s reasoner fulfills the role of the analyze component, executing ROSA’s inference rules (Figure 3
to infer new data when the KB is queried. Thus, since TypeDB’s reasoner is part of TypeDB, there is no
separate analyze component.
