The application of deep learning approaches to segmenta-
tion analysis of 2D and 3D images was discussed in a study by
[35]. The study highlighted that while applying deep learning
methods to segmentation analysis might seem straightforward
for humans, it remains a challenge for computers due in part
to the limited understanding of the functioning and processing
mechanisms of the human brain. The study categorized super-
vised learning-based techniques into encoder-decoder architect-
ure-based, compositional architecture-based, attention-based, se-
mantic concept-based, stylized captions, dense image caption-
ing, and novel object-based image captioning, as outlined by
[2].
