It is important to note that the spatial information extracted
from the two-dimensional image is crucial for both soft- and
hard-attention mechanisms. The extracted annotation vector
contains features of each color channel in a 3-dimensional spa-
tial feature vector since the images are represented using three
color channels (red, blue, and green). Once the set of spatial
features attended is determined, they are ready for use [31].
Soft and hard attention can be seen in Fig.12. In this illustra-
tive figure, you can observe how soft attention demonstrates the
relative importance of each part of the image to the other parts.
In contrast, hard attention separates specific parts of the image
