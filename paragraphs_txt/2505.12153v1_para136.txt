The FDRL Algorithm Algo.1 ensures privacy-preserving
model training in a FL setting for RAS. The algorithm is
structured into three primary stages. In the first stage, each
hospital independently trains its RL policy using its private
dataset while ensuring privacy through DP noise injection
before transmitting model updates. The second stage involves
secure federated aggregation, where the Federated Aggregator
(FA) collects encrypted policy updates from multiple hospitals
and processes them using SMPC and HE to maintain strict
privacy compliance. Finally, in the third stage, dynamic policy
selection takes place, where the surgical robot evaluates fed-
erated policies using predefined surgical performance metrics
and selects the optimal policy for RAS.
