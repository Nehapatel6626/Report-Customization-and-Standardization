In qualitatively evaluating our results, we discovered that sometimes, when the algorithm came up with about 20 different utterances, it was usually possible to find among them something sensible. However, frequently some path prefix would be scored highly likely, and would come to dominate our priority queue; all the paths in the priority queue would start with it. If it was non-sensical (e.g. ‘And I will I’), as was frequently the case, none of the resulting utterances would be good candidates for a mnemonic. To address this problem, we made the search interactive, allowing the user to select at each stage of the search which of the paths in our priority queue to keep.
