Image captioning was initially performed using traditional
machine learning techniques before advancement in deep learn-
ing methods [89]. Pattern recognition systems have played an
important role in solving computer vision tasks related to im-
ages [90]. Unsupervised and semantic segmentation approaches,
which typically require less time and data than recent deep learn-
ing techniques, were commonly used [91]. In a study by [54], a
three-stage root word-based method was proposed to generate
Arabic captions for images. This involved creating image frag-
ments using a pre-trained deep neural network on ImageNet and
mapping them to a set of root words in Arabic. Furthermore, a
deep belief network pre-trained by restricted Boltzmann ma-
chines was utilized to extract the most suitable words for the
image [92].
