combined with lidar or Kinect, and the aruco algorithm can only be combined with a camera. In low-light
conditions, the camera can only be used with a lamp. Furthermore, the robot can move at three different
speeds. Each configuration has a different energy cost, safety, and accuracy level. This scenario can be
solved with ROSA with the knowledge model depicted in Figure 811.
