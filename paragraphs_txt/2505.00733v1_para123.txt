The architectural knowledge enables parameter adaptation by capturing each parameter configuration
of a component with a distinct component configuration relationship, relating one Component to a
set of Component Parameters. It enables structural adaptation by capturing the different possibilities
for solving a system functionality as distinct function design relationships which relate a Function
to a set of Components. It enables TACA by indirectly capturing the dependencies between the robotâ€™s
actions and architecture with the functional requirement relationship which relates an Action to
the Functions it requires.
