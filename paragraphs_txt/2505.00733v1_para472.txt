Figure 9. Snippet of the BT used to capture SUAVE’s task and adaption logic. WV and BL represent the
measured water visibility and battery level, respectively. GSP, MM, and FP represent SUAVE’s generate
search path node, maintain motion node, and follow pipeline node, respectively. The set action changes the
system’s modes.
