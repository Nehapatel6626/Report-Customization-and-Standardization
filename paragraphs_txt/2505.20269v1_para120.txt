To check the unsatisfiability of the expression C ∧ F ∧ ¬E, we still need to
take into account the formula ¬E, referring to the prediction of the ANN. Given
an input C predicted as class ci by the ANN, formula E must be equivalent to
(cid:86)N
j=1,j̸=i oi > oj. This formula asserts that the maximum value of the last layer
is in output oi. Therefore, ¬E must ensure that (cid:87)N
j=1,j̸=i oi ≤ oj. Since MILP
solvers can not directly represent disjunctions, we use implications (6) and a
linear constraint (7) over binary variables to define ¬E.
