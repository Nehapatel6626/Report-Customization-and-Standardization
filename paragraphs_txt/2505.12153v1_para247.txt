In the proposed FDRL framework, HE is explicitly em-
ployed to safeguard privacy during the aggregation of local
model parameters. Each participating hospital encrypts its
local model parameters (weights or gradients) using HE before
sending them to the federated aggregation server. This process
ensures strict privacy of all model updates throughout the
entire aggregation procedure. Specifically, HE enables the
federated aggregator to perform arithmetic operations (e.g.,
addition and averaging) directly on encrypted data, thereby
preserving privacy by preventing the exposure of sensitive
intermediate gradient or weight information. The secure ag-
gregation process using HE operates as follows. Each hospi-
tal encrypts its local model parameters using a public key,
yielding encrypted parameters Enc(θi) = HE.Encpk(θi),
where HE.Enc denotes the HE function. These encrypted
parameters are then securely transmitted to the federated
aggregation server, i.e., Hospital I → Server : Enc(θi).
