This work assumes that the robotics architecture is layered, containing a bottom functional layer,
an upper task decision layer, and an arbitrary number of layers in between, as common in robotics
architectures (Barnett et al., 2022). The functional layer is responsible for interacting with the robots’
sensors and actuators, and the task decision layer is responsible for task planning and execution3. To enable
TACA with ROSA, the task decision layer shall use the knowledge contained in ROSA’s KB to decide
which actions to perform, and it must update the KB with the actions selected to be performed to enable
ROSA to configure the robot’s architecture accordingly. To enable architectural adaptation, the robotic
architecture must be component-based, its components must be able to be activated and deactivated at
runtime, and its components’ parameters must be able to be adapted at runtime.
