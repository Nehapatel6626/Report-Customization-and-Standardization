The automatic captioning of images in Indonesian was de-
veloped by [81]. The model comprises three components: an
image extractor that generates feature vectors using CNN, a se-
quence processor that encodes linguistic sequences based on
LSTM using the output from the previous step, and a decoder
that predicts the caption of a new image based on the vector im-
age features and vocabulary input. The test set showed promis-
ing results.
