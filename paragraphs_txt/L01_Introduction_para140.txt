The tip of the iceberg:
First-generation algorithms: neural nets, decision trees, regression, support vector machines, kernel methods, Bayesian networks,â€¦
Composite algorithms - ensembles
Significant work on assessing effectiveness, limits
Applied to simple data bases
Budding industry (especially in data mining)
