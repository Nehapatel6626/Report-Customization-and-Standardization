Future work can concentrate upon examining if a naïve Bayes approach is actually required at each leaf node, or if a naïve Bayes at just a subset of the leaf nodes would be sufficient.   Another interesting question is whether the naïve Bayes model at a leaf node should contain all the remaining attributes, or if a large number of irrelevant attributes can be eliminated.  There are numerous such questions that arise about the interaction of the hybrid technique with various parameters.  The more the questions we answer, the greater the understanding obtained.
