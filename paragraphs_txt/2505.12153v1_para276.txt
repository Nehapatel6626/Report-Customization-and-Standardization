In traditional machine learning, the IID assumption is key
for model convergence and generalization. Nonetheless, this
assumption often fails in real-world medical FL, particularly
in RAS, due to substantial variability in hospital data stemming
from differences in patient demographics, disease prevalence,
genetic profiles, clinical protocols, and data annotation meth-
ods. These inherent non-IID traits typically lead to delayed
global model convergence, client drift, reduced generalizabil-
ity, and increased communication overhead. To address these
difficulties, our proposed FDRL framework incorporates: (i)
weighted aggregation to handle data imbalance, (ii) proximal
regularization, drawing on FedProx, to reduce client drift, (iii)
a MSS for dynamic policy adaptation tailored to personalized
surgical decisions, and (iv) simulated non-IID settings for
robustness testing. Experimental findings reveal
that even
with a high degree of data heterogeneity (H = 0.8), our
FDRL framework maintains stable surgical accuracy ( 91%),
Minimises policy divergence, and achieves an optimal privacy-
utility balance, confirming its efficacy in highly varied medical
environments.
