Despite the encoding by Fischetti and Jo [5] achieved a better average running
time for computing explanations in 7 out of 12 cases, both encodings generally
perform similarly when considering the variability of the time. For instance, in
the spect dataset, the average execution time of the encoding by Fischetti and
Jo [5] (2.64 seconds) falls within the range of the average minus the standard
deviation of our approach (3.21 âˆ’ 1.81). This pattern is observed across several
