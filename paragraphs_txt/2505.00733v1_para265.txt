ROSA is implemented as a ROS 2-based system, where the MAPE-K components (depicted in Figure 1)
are realized as ROS nodes, and interfaces are implemented using ROS services or topics. The proposed
ROSA implementation uses ROS (Robot Operating System) as its robotics framework since ROS is the
current de facto standard robotics framework, and it has been designed, among other things, to promote
software reusability in the robotics ecosystem Macenski et al. (2022). In this implementation, ROS
handles the communication between system components, schedules callbacks for incoming messages
and events, and manages the lifecycle of ROS nodes. The full ROSA implementation is available at
