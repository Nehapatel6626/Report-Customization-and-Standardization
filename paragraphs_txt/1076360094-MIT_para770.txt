Figure 3-1: Active Defender Sytem Design: The Active Defender system uses the
SMDA framework design and deploy a system to build and deploy a decision system.
First the system is initialized by Synthesizing training data, learning a probabilistic
model, and tuning the decision function. After the system is deployed it is used to
decide on new data including evasive data generated by the attacker. After a decision
is made on newly received data, the system adapts to update the model and decision
function
