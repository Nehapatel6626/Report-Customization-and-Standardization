A number of techniques are available to perform machine learning.  Decision trees [5-9], the naïve Bayes approach [11-17], and the more general Bayes net approach are a few of the choices.  The naïve Bayes approach is an instance of the more general Bayes nets. This paper examines and analyzes the naïve Bayes and decision tree approaches to learning.  Various techniques to avoid over-fitting, such as ensemble construction and cross-validation are also implemented and analyzed.
