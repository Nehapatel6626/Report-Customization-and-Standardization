To demonstrate TACA, this work extends SUAVE with an (A3) recharge battery action and a (U3) battery
level uncertainty. With these extensions, the AUV’s battery level can suddenly drop to a critical level,
requiring the AUV to abort the action it is performing (A1 or A2) and perform A3. In this situation, the
AUV needs to perform TACA by adapting its task execution and architecture to perform A3. To better
evaluate ROSA by serving as a baseline for comparison, this work extends the SUAVE exemplar with a
managing subsystem where the adaptation logic is implemented with BTs, and the AUV’s architectural
variants as well as the architectural adaptation execution are realized with System Modes (Nordmann et al.,
2021)1. Furthermore, this work introduces a new reaction time metric that represents the time a managing
system takes to react to uncertainties and adapt the managed subsystem.
