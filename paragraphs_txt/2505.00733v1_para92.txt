Hern´andez et al. (2018); Bozhinoski et al. (2022) proposed Metacontrol as a knowledge-based solution
for parameter and structural adaptation. Metacontrol leverages the TOMASys (Hern´andez et al., 2018)
ontology to capture the knowledge required for the adaptation logic and to reason at runtime to decide when
and how the system should adapt. Similar to RRA, Metacontrol decomposes the system into functionalities,
using TOMASys to represent the robot’s functionalities, the architectural variants that implement each
functionality, and the non-functional requirements associated with these variants. However, Metacontrol
cannot perform TACA as TOMASys does not capture the relationship between the system functionalities
and the robot’s actions.
