In the following, we apply the same algorithm from Figure 1, but replacing
the encoding of F as in [5] with the one in [17]. We encode an ANN with L + 1
layers as in Equations (9), (4) and (5). The variables xl
i and oi have the same
meaning as in Equations (3)-(5). Furthermore, auxiliary variables sl
i are not
required, as observed in the encoding by Fischetti and Jo [5]. Constants lbl
i and
ubl
i. Again,
we find such bounds via a MILP solver. The behavior of ReLU is modeled using
these bounds and binary variables zl
i. If zl
i is
i,jxlâˆ’1
0. Otherwise, xl
i. The bounds lbli and ubli are
j=1 wl
necessary to maintain the integrity of the set of constraints for the entire feature
space. Regardless of the value of zli, the bounds ensure that the constraints
remain valid for the entire feature space.
