This work combines principles from self-adaptive systems and knowledge representation and reasoning to
design a reusable framework for developing adaptive robotics architectures. Section 3.1 analyzes existing
robotics architectures and describes the architectural patterns from robotics architectures adopted in this
work. Section 3.2 reviews related research on self-adaptive robotic systems that leverage knowledge
representation techniques to promote reusability, as well as studies that consider the relationship between
