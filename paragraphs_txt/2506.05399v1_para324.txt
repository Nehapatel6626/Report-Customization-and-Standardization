In addition, [57] developed the Arabic Description Model
(ADM) to generate full image descriptions in Arabic, compared
to an earlier model based on English. The image features were
obtained from CNN, and a JSON file containing image descrip-
tions in English was translated into Arabic and fed to an LSTM
network along with the CNN feature vector. The authors re-
ported that translating recognized English captions into Arabic
resulted in poor sentence structure, indicating that it is not a
viable approach.
