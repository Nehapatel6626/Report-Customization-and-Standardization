Abstract
Artiﬁcial intelligence requires deliberate reason-
ing, temporal awareness, and effective constraint
management—capabilities traditional LLMs of-
ten lack due to their reliance on pattern match-
ing,
limited self-veriﬁcation, and inconsistent
constraint handling. We introduce Multi-Agent
Collaborative Intelligence (MACI), a framework
comprising three key components: 1) a meta-
planner (MP) that identiﬁes, formulates, and re-
ﬁnes all roles and constraints of a task (e.g., wed-
ding planning) while generating a dependency
graph, with common-sense augmentation to en-
sure realistic and practical constraints; 2) a col-
lection of agents to facilitate planning and ad-
dress task-speciﬁc requirements; and 3) a run-
time monitor that manages plan adjustments as
needed. By decoupling planning from validation,
maintaining minimal agent context, and integrat-
ing common-sense reasoning, MACI overcomes
the aforementioned limitations and demonstrates
robust performance in two scheduling problems.
