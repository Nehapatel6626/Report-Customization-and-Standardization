Decision trees consume memory at rapid rates.  Pruning [5-9] is required to keep memory utilization at modest levels. [6] is a backtracking approach that grows the tree and prunes as required.  Though the final tree may be small, the process dictated in [6] is memory consuming during the tree growth process.  [7] discusses pruning from the viewpoint of increasing simplicity.  A complex yet accurate tree is pruned to increase its simplicity, hence enhancing understanding.  Pruning should not tradeoff the accuracy beyond tolerable limits though.  [8] takes the interesting approach of searching for pruned trees in a search space.  [9] contains an approach that uses a statistical significance test, chi square value cut-offs, to prune trees.  [5] is a general comparison of numerous approaches.
