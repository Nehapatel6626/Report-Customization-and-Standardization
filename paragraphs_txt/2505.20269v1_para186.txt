Proof. If an assignment A satisfies (cid:87)N
j is true under
̸= i. Let A′ = A ∪ {qj (cid:55)→ v | v = 1 if j = j′, else v = 0, for j ∈
A for j′
{1, ..., N }\{i}} be an assignment. Then, A′ imposes that oi ≤ o′
j in Equation (10)
for j = j′, which in clearly true under this assignment. For j ̸= j′, it follows that
oi − oj ≤ (ubi − lbj) must hold, which is also true under A′ since lbj ≤ oj and
oi ≤ ubi.
