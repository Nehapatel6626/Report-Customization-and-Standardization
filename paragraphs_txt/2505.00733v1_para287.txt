Interfaces: The KB component abstracts the details of interacting with TypeDB with the ROS interfaces
it implements, enabling the MAPE components to read and write knowledge via the interfaces described
in Table 5. When the MAPE components request or send data to the KB component via these interfaces,
the KB component queries the TypeDB database to retrieve or write knowledge. For example, when the
task decision layer calls the service /action/selectable to retrieve the name of the selectable Actions (i.e.,
actions that do not have an ‘unfeasible’ status), the KB component performs the TypeQL query depicted
in Listing 3 to retrieve the name (unique identifiers) of the selectable Actions. When data is written in
the KB, the KB component publishes a message in the /events topic specifying which type of data was
written, i.e., ‘monitoring data’, ‘action update’, ‘reconfiguration plan’. Additionally, the KB component
provides the /query service, which can be used to perform any TypeDB query to the database. It is not used
in ROSA’s runtime workflow, but it enables users to perform custom queries, for example, to retrieve all
reconfiguration plans that were executed.
