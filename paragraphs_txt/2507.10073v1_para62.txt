The ANOVA results provide strong evidence that current LLMs, despite generating su-
perficially different text when prompted with different cultural personas, often fail to
produce statistically distinct response patterns that would reflect genuine differences in
moral frameworks. This homogenization effect undermines the validity of using these
models to represent diverse cultural perspectives in synthetic social science research.
