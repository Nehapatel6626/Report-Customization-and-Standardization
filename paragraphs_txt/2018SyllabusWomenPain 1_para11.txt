A given in this life is that we all experience painâ€”physical and psychological.  In this course students will explore the particular sources of pain experienced by women in contemporary society.  We will seek together, first, an adequate theodicy for dealing with pain, and second, a deeper understanding of the complex presenting problems many women experience.  Then we will search out effective ways to help women manage painful events or circumstances in their lives, within the context of a truthful Christian theodicy. (MACO degree goals 2, 4, 5, 7, 8)
