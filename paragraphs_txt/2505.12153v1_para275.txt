7 provides a comparison of FL and CL across various per-
formance metrics. The results demonstrate that FL, despite its
privacy-preserving advantages, achieves comparable or even
superior accuracy in certain aspects. Specifically, FL exhibits a
15% increase in risk mitigation compared to CL, underscoring
its potential for enhancing safety and reliability. Furthermore,
FL significantly outperform CL in terms of privacy, with
P-Leakage values reduced by 60% and Policy Divergence
reduced by 50%. The OPE score, combining both P-Leakage
and policy divergence, is also higher for FL, indicating a more
favourable balance between privacy and performance. These
results underscore the potential of FL to match or surpass the
accuracy of CL while offering stronger privacy assurances,
especially in sensitive areas like healthcare.
