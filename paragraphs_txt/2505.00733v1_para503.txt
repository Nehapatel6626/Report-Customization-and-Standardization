This work proposed ROSA, a knowledge-based solution for task-and-architecture co-adaptation in robotic
systems that promotes reusability, extensibility, and composability. Reusability was achieved by proposing
a knowledge model that can capture the knowledge required for TACA and using it at runtime to reason
about adaptation. Extensibility and composability were achieved with an architectural design that allows
ROSA’s components to be stateless and self-contained. The feasibility of using ROSA in robotic systems at
runtime was demonstrated by applying it in simulation to the SUAVE exemplar. ROSA’s reusability was
demonstrated by using it to model different self-adaptive robotic systems and showing that it can capture
all relevant knowledge for adaptation necessary for these use cases. Furthermore, ROSA’s development
effort and its scalability were demonstrated for the use cases presented in this paper and for a hypothetical
scenario.
