Figure 8-4: Active Defender Average Classiﬁcation Time over Adaptation. In this
ﬁgure we observe the estimated average classiﬁcation time per ﬁle at each stage. We
plot the mean time score as points and show the standard deviation in the surrounding
band. Here we see that the average classiﬁcation time is pretty low – around 1 second
– throughout the course of the experiment, and decreases over time. In addition, the
deviation in time is small across successive stages, and is not observable due to the
estimation function.
