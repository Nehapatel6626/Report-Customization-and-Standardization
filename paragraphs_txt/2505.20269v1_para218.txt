The first experiment compared the two encodings presented on the 12
datasets. The architecture of the trained ANNs is two hidden layers with 20
neurons each. For each dataset and the associated ANN, the explanation of each
instance was obtained using the Algorithm 1 and both presented encodings. The
second experiment performed the comparison of the two encodings presented
using the voting dataset of the first experiment. This experiment was conducted
in two cases. In the first case, the trained ANNs consist of one hidden layer with
the number of neurons ranging from 10 to 100. In the second case, the ANNs
consist of two hidden layers such that both layers contains the same number of
neurons, ranging from 10 to 40. In both cases, the number of neurons in the
layers increases in increments of 5. Again, the explanations of each instance was
obtained using Algorithm 1 and both presented encodings. The objective of this
experiment is to verify the influence of the number of layers and the number of
neurons in both encodings.
