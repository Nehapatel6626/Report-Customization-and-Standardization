There will be THREE examinations. Please see the schedule below for the dates and times of each examination. Exams are multiple choice. Exam questions will cover both text and class material. There will be material on the exam not discussed in the text (i.e. case discussions, videos, and class activities), so it is imperative that you come to class. Exams are not cumulative.
