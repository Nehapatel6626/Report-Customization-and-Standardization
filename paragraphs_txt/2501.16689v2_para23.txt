2. Common and Task-speciﬁc Agents. MACI employs two
types of agents to execute the generated plans:
- Common Agents: These agents handle general-purpose
tasks, including constraint validation, practical reason-
ing, and performance evaluation. For instance, a Com-
mon Sense Integration agent
identiﬁes implicit con-
straints, while a Constraint Validation agent ensures fea-
sibility and compliance with the task’s requirements.
