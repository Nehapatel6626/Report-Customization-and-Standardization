Figure 6-2: Active Defender Hierarchical Decision Algorithm: A PDF is ﬁrst sent
to the PDFRate classiﬁer (C1). Based on the output of PDFrate, p1, a decision is
made whether to return a result or send the ﬁle to the Cuckoo classiﬁer (C2).
If
the ﬁle is sent to the Cuckoo classiﬁer, the results from PDFRate (p1), and Cuckoo
(p2) are sent to the secondary classiﬁer C4 and a decision is made as to whether to
return a result or sent the ﬁle to VirusTotal (C3). If the ﬁle is sent to the VirusTotal
classiﬁer, classiﬁcation scores from the PDFRate (p1), Cuckoo (p2), and VirusTotal
(p3) classiﬁers are sent to the C5 secondary classiﬁer and a ﬁnal decision is made.
