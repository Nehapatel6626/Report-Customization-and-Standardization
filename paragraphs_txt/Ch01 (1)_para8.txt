What’s easy and what’s hard?
It’s been easier to mechanize many of the high level cognitive tasks we usually associate with “intelligence” in people
 e. g., symbolic integration, proving theorems, playing chess, some aspect of medical diagnosis, etc.
It’s been very hard to mechanize tasks that animals can do easily
walking around without running into things
catching prey and avoiding predators
interpreting complex sensory information (visual, aural, …)
modeling the internal states of other animals from their behavior
working as a team (ants, bees)
Is there a fundamental difference between the two categories?
Why some complex problems (e.g., solving differential equations, database operations) are not subjects of AI
