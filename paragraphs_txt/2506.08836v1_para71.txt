The sample generation process resulted in the sample length distribution
depicted in Figure 1. Thus, the samples are considerably longer than in the cor-
pora in section 3. It is important to note that samples with lengths significantly
shorter than 30 seconds typically occur at the end of the original audio file or
cannot be merged with adjacent segments, as doing so would lead to sample
lengths exceeding 30 seconds.
