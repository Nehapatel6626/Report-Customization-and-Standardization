The distribution design involves making decisions on the fragmentation and placement of data across the sites of a computer network. The first phase of the distribution design is the fragmentation phase, which is the focus of this work. To fragment a class of objects, it is possible to use two basic techniques: horizontal and vertical fragmentation [28], which may be combined and applied in many different ways to define the final fragmentation schema.
