Myanmarâ€™s [84] proposed an image captioning method com-
bining two parts: CNN for image feature extraction and LSTM
for text generation. New datasets were built based on the Flickr8k
dataset. The new datasets used 3,000 images from the Flickr8k
dataset, each with five annotated Myanmar captions. This ap-
proach reduced the manual captioning time by translating the
sentences. The generated text was evaluated using BLEU, and
satisfactory results were obtained.
