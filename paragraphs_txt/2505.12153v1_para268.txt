Moreover, Overall OPE is 25.8% higher in FL, reinforcing
its superior ability to balance data protection with learning
efficiency. Although Task-Specific Accuracy is nearly identical
between FL and CL, the added benefits of FL in risk mitigation
and privacy protection make it a more robust approach for
privacy-sensitive applications in RAS. The radar plot visually
confirms that FL maintains a strong competitive edge in
privacy-conscious AI-driven healthcare systems, making it a
preferable choice for real-world surgical environments where
both data security and procedural accuracy are critical.
