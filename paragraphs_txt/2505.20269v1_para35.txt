In this work, we use first-order logic (FOL) to give explanations with guarantees
of correctness. We use quantifier-free first-order formulas over the theory of linear
real arithmetic (LRA). Then, first-order variables are allowed to take values from
the real numbers R. For details, see [11]. Therefore, we consider formulas as
defined below:
