Finally, in the spam-detection domain, there are only two classes (i.e. spam and ham) and a false positive is much more expensive (say λ-times) than a false negative. We predict a test example as spam when P(y|x)/P(ŷ|x) > λ. [13] suggests how to choose  λ depending on the particular configuration in which the spam classifier is deployed; heeding to it we have used 9 for spam-classification. Note that λ=1 corresponds to choosing the class with the highest (“higher”, since there are only two classes) conditional probability.
