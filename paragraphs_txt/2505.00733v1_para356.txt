To evaluate ROSAâ€™s performance, metrics were collected with the SUAVE exemplar. The metrics
collected were the ones available in SUAVE, search time and distance of the pipeline inspected, in addition
to the reaction time metric introduced in this paper. For the original use case, the experiments were
performed with no managing subsystem, with a BT managing system, with Metacontrol9, and with ROSA.
For the extended use case, the experiments were performed with a BT managing system and with ROSA.
