standing pipelines as they effectively represent the relational
structure between objects in an image. The study provides a
detailed taxonomy of graph types employed in this domain, an
extensive review of GNN models applied to 2D image under-
standing, and a forward-looking roadmap for future research.
This survey covers key applications such as image captioning,
visual question answering, and image retrieval, specifically fo-
cusing on approaches that exploit GNN-based architectures.
