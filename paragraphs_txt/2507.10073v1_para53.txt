Cultural representation patterns The LLMs show varying degrees of alignment across
different cultural contexts. European perspectives — such as Belgium with multiple models
showing 𝑚𝑑 < 1.0 – are generally well-represented. However, we observe inconsistent
patterns in model alignment with non-Western perspectives. Some models represent South
African (𝑚𝑑 = 0.379 for Qwen2.5 7B) and Nigerian (𝑚𝑑 = 0.537 for Qwen2.5 72B)
perspectives with small distance while showing a significant deviation for others.
