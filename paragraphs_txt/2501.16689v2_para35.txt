2. Attention Bias and Constraint Drift. MACI avoids
relying on a single LLM to execute complex, multi-step
Instead, it utilizes small collabo-

rative agents that enjoy two key beneﬁts:
independence
and well-deﬁned input/output protocols (ensuring speci-
ﬁcity and quality) for speciﬁc tasks. These agents operate
within restricted context windows of e.g., 1k tokens, which
physically limits attention bias and ensures that earlier con-
straints are not overridden by recent context. By logi-
cally scoping problems and physically constraining context,
MACI preserves global feasibility and mitigates cognitive
tunneling.
