Table 5 shows the average number of inference calls to the GMN during the
identification, i.e., the average number of matched graphs needed to identify a
packer from a program. Removing the clustering approach, the similarity with
the input graph is evaluated with the entire collection. Thus, the metric is always
equal to the size of the entire collection. In contrast, the values we empirically
obtain with the use of the clustering approach show are close to the ideal number
of inference calls to identify the packer. The ideal number of inference calls in
the presence of the clustering approach is represented by the sum of m (number
of clusters) and the number of programs per packer stored in the DB. Thus,
we can state that, involving the clustering approach, the PackHero’s number of
inference calls does not depend on the number of packers but only on the number
of samples for each packer stored in the DB. To further emphasize the significance
of the results shown in Table 5, it is important to consider the inference time
for our GMN. Indeed, while this network’s expressive power surpasses that of
its alternatives, it comes with the trade-off of increased temporal complexity.
In this experiment, the average single inference time recorded was 1.76ms. The
