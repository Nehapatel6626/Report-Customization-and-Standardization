I  would  first like to thank Charlie  Sodini,  my thesis  advisor and  mentor through  out my
time  at MIT.  He  has not only  guided me  through my  academic journey,  but has also  helped me
think through numerous  personal  decisions.  It  has been a pleasure  and  honor working  with him.
Next,  I  want to thank  Tom O'Dwyer,  who provided weekly  technical  guidance  through out  this
research  project.  Tom brought  an  industry  perspective  to this  research,  which  included  helping us
focus on practical  technical  solutions.  Thank you Joel Voldman  and Dan Wu,  who have helped
me navigate  the wet lab  and biological  components  of my  research  with their  deep  intuition and
experience.  Also, thank  you to Ryan  O'Shea,  who  worked with me at the  early stages  of this
project.  And,  I  would  like to  give  a huge thank you to Analog  Devices Inc.,  who funded  me  and
my project through  out my time  at MIT.
