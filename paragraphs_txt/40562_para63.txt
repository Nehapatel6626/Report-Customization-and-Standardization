There will be three exams: two midterms and one final. All exams will be multiple-choice with some short answer questions. The final exam will be cumulative.  Exams will be based upon material from lectures and assigned readings.  Students need to read all assigned chapters as well as attend each lecture and lab to be fully prepared for exams.  Make-up exams (for USC athletes) must be arranged prior to the missed class. There are no exceptions. The final exam cannot be missed.
