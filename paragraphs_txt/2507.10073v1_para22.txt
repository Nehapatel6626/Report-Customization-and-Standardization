Building on this foundation, our research systematically evaluates how LLMs represent
diverse cultural moral frameworks by applying the Moral Foundations Questionnaire
(MFQ-2) [atari2023morality] across 19 cultural contexts. By comparing multiple state-
of-the-art LLMs against human baseline data, we investigate whether these models can
faithfully represent the nuanced, culturally-specific moral intuitions that characterize human
moral reasoning. Our findings challenge assumptions about LLMsâ€™ capabilities for cultural
representation and highlight fundamental limitations in current AI alignment approaches.
