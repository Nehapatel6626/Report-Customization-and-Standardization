Each student will be allowed one absence without penalty. All other absences will be penalized unless verified by a reliable source such as a doctorâ€™s note. Certain classes may be worth more than other classes due to their importance, such as survey days and presentation days. Please notify the teaching assistant in case of serious illness or other emergencies.
