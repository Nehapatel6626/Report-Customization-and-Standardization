Another essential information needed by FORTE for the theory revision process is the set of examples. For the TREND3 approach, they were derived from experimental results presented in [23, 25, 32] on top of the OO7 benchmark [12]. This benchmark describes a representative object oriented application and it has been used in many object database management systems to evaluate their performance in centralized environments. Unfortunately, there are no other performance results on top of distributed databases available in the literature, due to security or commercial reasons.
