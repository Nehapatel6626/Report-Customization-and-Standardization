Recall
Precision
function that computes the f1 score
precision recall weight – weight of precision vs recall
Function describing accuracy of a system
Speciﬁc evaluation function maximizing f1 score.
Speciﬁc evaluation function maximizing recall given precision above 0.9
Cost function
Enumeration function that generates initial threshold sets to evaluate
Diﬀerence in successive g() scores after which to stop optimizing thresholds
maximum number of iterations to run in each tuning step
