On the other hand, previous knowledge-based methods for RSASS(Park et al., 2012; Niemczyk and
Geihs, 2015; Niemczyk et al., 2017; Hochgeschwender et al., 2016; Hern´andez et al., 2018; Bozhinoski
et al., 2022) do not capture all knowledge required to enable TACA. They either lack the ability to capture
the relationship between the robot’s actions and architecture (Hochgeschwender et al., 2016; Hern´andez
et al., 2018; Bozhinoski et al., 2022), or the knowledge required to decide when and how the robotic
system should adapt (Park et al., 2012). Although these works do not capture all the knowledge required
for TACA, they are able to capture, to varying degrees, knowledge that supports RSASSs. Thus, this work
takes inspiration from them to design ROSA’s knowledge model while addressing their limitations. More
concretely, ROSA’s knowledge model is designed to capture the relationship between the robot’s actions
and architecture and the knowledge required to decide when and how TACA should be performed.
