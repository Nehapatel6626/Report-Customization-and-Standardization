where I(·) is an indicator function, ∆st denotes the state varia-
tion, and θ is a predefined threshold. A higher αadapt signifies
a more responsive policy, enhancing the model’s robustness
for real-world deployment. To ensure data confidentiality, we
integrate Differential Privacy (DP) into the federated training
process
