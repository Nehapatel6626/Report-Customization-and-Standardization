Example
When the AUV completes the
search pipeline action and starts
the inspect pipeline action,
the
reconfiguration plan
consists of deactivating the generate
search path node
spiral
and
activating the follow pipeline node
When the AUV starts the inspect
the component
pipeline action,
activation relates to the follow
pipeline node
When the AUV completes the
search
the
component deactivation
relates to the generate spiral search
path node
When the water visibility changes,
the parameter adaptation
consists of a parameter adaptation
of the component configuration of
the generate spiral search path node
