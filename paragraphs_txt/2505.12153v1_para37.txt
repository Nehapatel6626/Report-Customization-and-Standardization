The integration of RL into surgical robotics has demon-
strated significant potential for optimising surgical procedures,
enhancing precision, and minimising patient risk [1]. How-
ever, deploying RL in surgical settings presents substantial
challenges, including data scarcity, patient variability, privacy
concerns, and the need for dynamic policy adaptation. To
address these challenges, we propose a FDRL framework,
enabling multiple hospitals to collaboratively train RL models
