Once after the original plan was revised by MP to in-
clude more speciﬁc details, clarify ambiguous explicit con-
straints, and deﬁne implicit constraints, the performance
of the three LLMs used in the experiment improved sig-
niﬁcantly. When the augmented plan W∗ was input into
DeepSeek, GPT4o, and Claude, each model successfully
generated a feasible plan within two to three iterations.
(The case study in Section 3 shows that DeepSeek was con-
fusing and GPT4o repeatedly committed constraint viola-
tions.)
