Scientists have focused on top-down and bottom-up atten-
tion theories, and recent research has shown that top-down at-
tention mechanisms are still preferable. The top-down model
starts with an image as input and converts it to words [36]. All
methods that utilize bottom-up attention perform better because
bottom-up attention focuses on visual attention at the object
level. However, an important question arises: In some natural
settings, is it necessary for the model to pay attention to areas in
the image that do not contain recognizable objects but instead
include natural elements such as mountains, trees, skies, etc.?
On the other hand, using object detectors for bottom-up feature
extraction has drawbacks, as they may not be able to focus on
important areas for captions in unfamiliar domains. As a result,
additional knowledge from various domains may be necessary
for natural settings, and object detectors trained in more spe-
cialized tasks can provide this kind of knowledge [31].
