This trend is accelerating
Improved machine learning algorithms
Improved data capture, networking, faster computers
Software too complex to write by hand
New sensors / IO devices
Demand for self-customization to user, environment
It turns out to be difficult to extract knowledge from human expertsfailure of expert systems in the 1980’s.
