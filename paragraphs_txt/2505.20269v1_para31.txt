In the next section, we review some concepts and terminologies about Logic,
MILP and ANNs. Sections 3 and 4 show how to compute explanations with
and without implications, respectively. Section 4 describes our adaptation of the
encoding proposed in [17]. Experiments and results are presented in Section 5.
Finally, conclusions and future work are described in Section 6.
