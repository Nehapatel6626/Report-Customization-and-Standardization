In groups of 3 to 5 students, you will be conducting your own research.  In the group, you will create your own survey, collect data from other students in HP, analyze your findings, and present your report to the class.  You will present your study results using PowerPoint to ensure a professional looking presentation. Each team member must present part of your study.  The dates of the presentations will be determined later in the semester, but will fall between April 20 and April 27. See homework packet for instructions.
