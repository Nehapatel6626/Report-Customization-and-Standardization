To enable adaptation, the knowledge model captures what can be adapted with the architectural knowledge
depicted in Figure 2a; why to adapt and how to select an adaptation with the adaptation heuristics knowledge
depicted in Figure 2b; and how to execute an adaptation with the reconfiguration plan knowledge depicted
in Figure 2c. Tables 2-4 define each element in the model alongside examples based on SUAVE to ease its
understanding.
