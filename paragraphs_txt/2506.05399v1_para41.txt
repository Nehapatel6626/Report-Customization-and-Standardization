This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an
overview of related surveys in image captioning, summarizes
them, and discusses their foundations. Section 3 discusses the
methods employed in image captioning models. Section 4 de-
scribes relevant research in image captioning, classifying them
into five categories: handcrafted approaches, deep learning for
image captioning, transformer-based approaches, attention-based
approaches, and graph-based representation. Section 5 discusses
the datasets. Section 6 introduces the evaluation metrics used to
assess the quality and performance of generated captions. Limi-
tations and challenges are summarized in Section 7, and finally,
conclusions and future directions are presented in Section 8.
