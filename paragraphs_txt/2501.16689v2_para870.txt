Handling Long Dependencies Complex scheduling
problems reveal cascading errors when dependencies over-
lap. Key constraints, especially multi-factor dependencies,
often get dropped during iterative problem-solving.
Reason: Cognitive load limits simultaneous constraint
tracking, making exhaustive veriﬁcation difﬁcult in single
passes.
Solution Framework:
• Isolate and enumerate atomic task dependencies.
