In a CNN network, the higher layers are believed to capture
high-level semantic information. As a result, the output of the
fully connected layer can represent the imageâ€™s global informa-
tion. However, since this output lacks spatial information, the
output of the last convolutional layer is often utilized. This is
because the expanded receptive field of the higher layer in CNN
corresponds to a region of the original image, where each point
on the spatial feature map corresponds to a region of the origi-
nal image [97]. The architecture of the CNN model is shown in
Fig. 8.
