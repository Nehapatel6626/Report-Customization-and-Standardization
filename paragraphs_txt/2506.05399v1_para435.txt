Two test scenarios were proposed in [57]: (1) Machine trans-
lation approach – English image descriptions were translated
into Arabic using Google Translate, often leading to grammat-
(2) LSTM-based
ical errors and poorly structured sentences.
Arabic generation – Instead of relying on translation, an LSTM-
based Arabic language model was trained to generate more nat-
ural and grammatically accurate captions.
