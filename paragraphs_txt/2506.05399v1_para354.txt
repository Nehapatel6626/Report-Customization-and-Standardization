In their work, [47] introduced a new transformer-based model
that considers the relationships between different features within
an image. This model considers three types of spatial relation-
ships in the image regions: a query region can be a parent,
neighbor, or child. The model uses spatially adjacent matrices
to combine the output of parallel subtransformer layers. The
decoder includes an LSTM layer and an implicit transformer
layer, which work in parallel to decode different image regions.
Two new geometry-aware architectures were separately cre-
ated for the encoder and decoder to represent geometry better
[101]. This captioning model helps us understand the locations
of target objects and the objects the model is currently looking
at. The proposed model includes an improved encoder and may
provide information on an objectâ€™s relative geometry. Further-
more, it fully leverages geometry relations to enhance object
representations.
