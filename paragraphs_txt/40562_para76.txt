A summary of each lecture will be posted on Blackboard.   In most cases, the lecture notes will be posted by 10 pm prior to the following dayâ€™s class.  The lecture notes should not be used as a substitute for reading the chapters or attending lecture.   Though, the lecture notes should be helpful summary when preparing for exams since there will be no study guides distributed prior to exams.
