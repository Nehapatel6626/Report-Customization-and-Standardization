When asked to solve the problem without MP, Glaude and
GPT4o initially chose brute force, then switched to an ap-
proximation method without thorough deliberation (or per-
haps they did, but did not output their reasoning process).
However, DeekSeek picked Held-Karp, a computationally
expensive method, even more expensive than brute force,
arguing that the absolute computation time for N = 10
is only 0.2 seconds. MP was more deliberate, opting for
brute force when N = 5 and ACO for N = 10.
