Traditional methods of learning include the naïve Bayes model, learning a Bayes net structure, and decision trees.  The naïve Bayes approach uses a model that can be constructed very fast and is suited for learning when the attributes to be learnt upon are independent of each other.  Performance is poor if the attributes exhibit dependencies. A more complicated Bayes net structure could be learnt in such a case if the independence property does not hold amongst attributes.  This gives rise to more accurate predictions, but the actual construction takes large amounts of time.  As for a decision tree, while construction is a simple and easy-to-understand process, it is rather time and memory consuming.   Memory consumption problems are tackled with the use of pruning techniques.
