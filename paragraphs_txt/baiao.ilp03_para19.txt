In an object-oriented database, data is represented as objects. The set of objects sharing the same structure and behavior define a class, and classes may be related to each other through relationships. A database schema describes the set of classes and relationships. The UML diagram representing the database schema of the OO7 benchmark [12] is illustrated in figure 1. The OO7 benchmark is a generic application on top of a database of design objects assembled through the composition of parts. We may notice, for example, that each composite part is related to N atomic parts (through the “parts” relationship), and that each atomic part “is part of” one composite part.
