Precision is determined by the matching tuples between the
logical tuples for generated and reference captions divided by
the total number of logical tuples in the generated caption set.
For recall, the matching tuples are divided by the total num-
ber of logical tuples in the reference caption set. The F1 score
(SPICE) is calculated using precision and recall [27]. Scene
graphs (G(c) and G(S r) are created from candidate and refer-
ence captions, respectively), and the F score is calculated using
the conjunction of logical tuples representing semantic propo-
sitions in the scene graph. SPICE can be calculated using the
scene graphs of all reference sentences as
