Due to the possibility of word pairings never occurring in the text processed, a uniform small probability was assigned to unseen bigrams. We found that smoothing was not very important for our application, we controlled utterance generation, and our corpora was rich enough to almost always allow us to use previously seen bigrams, even when subject to the constraints of the mnemonic being generated; this was highly desirable as it increased the likelihood that the utterance generated would make sense.
