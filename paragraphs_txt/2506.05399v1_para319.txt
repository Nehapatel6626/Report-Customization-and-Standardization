works - long short-term memory encoder-decoder model
The work of [93] proposed a multi-modal attention mech-
anism for generating news image captions. This mechanism
combines visual and textual attention to generate captions from
news images and text. The goal is to ensure that the caption
of a news image reflects the specific event reported, making it
different from a general caption. More than 98% attention was
paid to the text, while the rest focused on the image.
