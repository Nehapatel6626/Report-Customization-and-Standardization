The system outputs a set of possible mnemonics that match the specifications of the item to be remembered and the userâ€™s preference in sentence lexicon.  This allows the user to subjectively decide which generated sentence will be easier to remember and recall (and decipher) later.  A larger number of sentences also precludes the possibility of all sentences being invalid.
