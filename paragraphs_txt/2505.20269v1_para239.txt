number of neurons and layers increases. Furthermore, our experimental results
suggest that our adaptation is generally more efficient for ANNs with one hidden
layer, while the performance advantage diminishes for ANNs with two hidden
layers. However, our proposal achieved a better running time for building the
encoding for ANNs with two layers, showing an improvement of up to 18%. This
can help to decrease the scalability issue for building the logical constraints given
an ANN. Furthermore, this encoding obtained better results also in the overall
time, i.e., the time for computing explanations plus the time for building the
logical constraints, showing an improvement of up to 16%.
