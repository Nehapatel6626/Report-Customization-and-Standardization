To make  synthetic  urine  solutions,  we followed  four  steps  (shown  in Figure  6-4).
Briefly, we  1)  generated  reference  solutions  for each particle,  2) determined  the  concentrations
of these  reference  solutions,  3) mixed  together predetermined  amounts  of the reference  solution,
and 4)  diluted the  mixture with  buffer.
