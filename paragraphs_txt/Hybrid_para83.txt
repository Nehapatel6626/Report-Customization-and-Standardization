classifiers however perform, nearly as well as decision trees, even for higher χ-values. Hence, given a decision tree with some χ value v1, we can obtain a Hybrid classifier, with χ value v2,  such that v1 < v2 but the Hybrid still performs as well as the decision tree. Since v1 < v2, the hybrid would have fewer nodes than the corresponding decision tree. Thus if memory is a constraint, we get nearly the same performance as decision trees without running into the memory problems that the latter does.
