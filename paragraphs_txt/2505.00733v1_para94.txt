limitations in reusability and practical applicability in robotics. The authors of MORPH (Braberman et al., 2017)
note that no complete system has been developed, and they have not demonstrated its feasibility. While the
approach proposed by C´amara et al. (2020) provides the most complete solution to TACA in the literature,
it also faces reusability limitations by relying on multiple distinct domain-specific language (DSL) models
and requiring task-specific implementations for model transformations. To address these limitations, this
work proposes capturing all the knowledge required for adaptation logic in a single knowledge model.
This approach requires only one model–conforming to the proposed knowledge model–to be designed for
each application. Additionally, an open-source reference implementation of ROSA is provided, enabling
researchers to reuse, extend, and build upon the proposed solution.
