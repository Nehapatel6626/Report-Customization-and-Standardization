In Show, Attend, and Tell, attention involves a set of at-
tended visual features (z) generated from an attention function
(fatt), which can be soft deterministic or hard and stochastic. In
soft attention, the input to the LSTM comprises weighted image
characteristics that take attention into account rather than the
image x. Soft attention reduces the weight of irrelevant places
with low attention, which helps to focus on relevant areas.
