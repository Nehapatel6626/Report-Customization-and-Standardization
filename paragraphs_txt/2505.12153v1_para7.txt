Abstractâ€”The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL)
into robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) holds significant promise
for advancing surgical precision, adaptability, and autonomous
decision-making. However, the development of robust RL models
in clinical settings is hindered by key challenges, including strin-
gent patient data privacy regulations, limited access to diverse
surgical datasets, and high procedural variability. To address
these limitations, this paper presents a Federated Deep Reinforce-
ment Learning (FDRL) framework that enables decentralized
training of RL models across multiple healthcare institutions
without exposing sensitive patient information. A central innova-
tion of the proposed framework is its dynamic policy adaptation
mechanism, which allows surgical robots to select and tailor
patient-specific policies in real-time, thereby ensuring personal-
ized and Optimised interventions. To uphold rigorous privacy
standards while facilitating collaborative learning, the FDRL
framework incorporates secure aggregation, differential privacy,
and homomorphic encryption techniques. Experimental results
demonstrate a 60% reduction in privacy leakage compared to
conventional methods, with surgical precision maintained within
a 1.5% margin of a centralized baseline. This work establishes a
foundational approach for adaptive, secure, and patient-centric
AI-driven surgical robotics, offering a pathway toward clinical
translation and scalable deployment across diverse healthcare
environments.
