LLM responses reveal critical ﬂaws: 1) DeepSeek violates
core constraints by unjustiﬁably delaying dinner to 7:00
PM (vs. the 6:00 PM deadline); and 2) GPT-4o (Table 3)
commits a safety violation: leaving the oven unattended,
despite explicit constraints. These errors highlight LLMs’
inability to reliably maintain and validate constraints dur-
ing replanning, even with full information.
