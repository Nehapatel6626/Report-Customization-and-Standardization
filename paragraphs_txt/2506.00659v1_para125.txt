introduce a clustering approach that reduces inference time and improves iden-
tification performance, as demonstrated in our Experimental Validation. Each
cluster contains graphs from only a single packer, allowing the identification
of potential sub-groups within the same packer. This packer unicity is ensured
by constructing the distance matrix in an intra-packer manner, as expressed in
Algorithm 2. This approach can mitigate variations in unpacking stubs due to
different configurations or versions of the same packer [16]. PackHero employs
hierarchical clustering with a single linkage merge criterion, using a distance
matrix derived from the trained GMN as input. The silhouette score [38] de-
termines the optimal number of flat clusters for each packer. Finally, PackHero
computes a medoid for each cluster, representing the graph with the minimal
sum of dissimilarities to all other graphs in the cluster [38].
