Ignatiev et al. [8] proposed an algorithm that computes minimal explanations for
ANNs, yielding a subset of the input features sufficient for the prediction. This
approach is based on logic with guarantees on the correctness and minimality of
explanations. A flowchart for computing explanations using such an algorithm
is shown in Figure 1.
