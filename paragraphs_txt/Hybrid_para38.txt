Cross-validation is the process of constructing a set of learners from a given training set and choosing the best of the generated set.  A parameter, k, to indicate the number of learners to be constructed is required.  The given training data set is divided into k different parts.  To construct the learner, one of the k parts is used as the test data, while the rest k-1 are used for the training data.  Each tree has a distinct test data set.  In this manner, k learners are constructed, and the best of them is chosen.
