The purpose of the [26] study is to present a thorough re-
view of image captioning techniques. The researcher created
a taxonomy of visual encoding and language modeling tech-
niques, emphasizing their essential features and restrictions. A
comprehensive survey was presented in [2]. This survey report
provided an analysis of current deep learning-based image cap-
tioning methods, and a taxonomy of image captioning meth-
ods was provided. This study concluded that although deep
learning-based image captioning techniques have made signifi-
cant strides in recent years, a reliable technique still needs to be
developed.
