This phase comprises three steps, depicted in Fig. 2.
1i Graph Extraction. PackHero must first obtain the CG specific to the
unpacking stub extracted through the previously mentioned heuristic.
2i Similarity Evaluation. The second step consists of evaluating the simi-
larity between the embeddings computed by the GMN for the input graph and
the graphs in the DB. Comparing the input graph against all graphs in the
DB may be computationally expensive and decrease the general identification
performance. Hence, PackHero computes the cosine similarity between the in-
put graph and the medoids associated with each computed cluster to select the
“closer” clusters. In other words, each PackHero identification corresponds at
least to m GMN inferences, where m is the number of clusters. PackHero selects
clusters represented by medoids with a positive cosine similarity with the input
graph. Once the clusters are selected, PackHero evaluates the similarity between
the input graph and each graph contained in the selected clusters.
3i Packer Identification. Now, up to m clusters are identified as potential
matches, and the similarity between the input graph and all graphs within these
m clusters is computed. PackHero identifies the packer with the highest score
