â€¢ We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of
the proposed FDRL framework using critical metrics
such as Privacy Leakage Rate (PLR) and Overall Pri-
vacy Effectiveness (OPE), demonstrating its superiority
in achieving a favourable privacy-utility trade-off under
varying levels of data heterogeneity.
