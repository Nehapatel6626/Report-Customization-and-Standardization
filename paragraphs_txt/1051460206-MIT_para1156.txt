be  seen in Figure 4-7,  the overall  accuracy of a CNN  clearly  decreases  as the  resolution
decreases.  The  accuracy  decreased  by  1.4%  from 91.4% at resolution of 1.36um to 90.0% at a
resolution of 4.56um. The resolution  is reduced by  a factor  of 3.35  while the accuracy  is only
reduced  by  1.4%.  This result  implies that majority  of features necessary  to accurately  classify the
particles is still included  in the information  represented  in images  with a resolution  of 4.56um.
Similar results  hold for a resolution  of 1 Oum  at 84.7%  accuracy.  More importantly,  these results
