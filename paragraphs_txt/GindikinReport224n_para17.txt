Mnemonics work by using the associational nature of the human memory system, as well as the differences in the ease with which various things are remembered based on their semantic categorization and relatedness. There are many various types of mnemonics depending on what is being memorized, but they all usually leverage the relative ease with which people remember spatial or natural language information, as well as the ability to guide the recall using various constraints. For example, people are not very good at memorizing ordered sequences of unrelated objects; for instance stars are classified by their spectra into seven categories in order of decreasing temperature: O, B, A, F, G, K and M. Rather than memorizing this unrelated sequence of letters its much easier to remember the mnemonic “oh be a fine girl, kiss me”, where the first letter of each word gives the desired sequence.
