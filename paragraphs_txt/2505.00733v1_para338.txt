To enable the use of the BehaviorTree.CPP package to implement BTs for ROSA and abstract away the
interactions with the KB, this work implements a reusable custom condition node called IsActionFeasible
and a custom action node called RosaAction. The condition node queries the KB to check whether an
Action is feasible before selecting it to be executed, and the action node queries the KB to request or
cancel an Action when the execution of an action starts or finishes, respectively.
