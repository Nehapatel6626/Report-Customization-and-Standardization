a novel normalization method and demonstrated its feasibility
and advantages for hidden activation within self-attention. They
proposed a geometry-aware self-attention (GSA) class that ex-
tends self-attention to explicitly consider relative geometry re-
lations between objects in an image for feature extraction.
