Abstract. This work presents the application of theory revision to the design of distributed databases to automatically revise a heuristic-based algorithm (called analysis algorithm) through the use of the FORTE system. The analysis algorithm decides the fragmentation technique to be used in each class of the database and its Prolog implementation is provided as the initial domain theory. Fragmentation schemas with previously known performance, obtained from experimental results on top of an object database benchmark, are provided as the set of examples. We show the effectiveness of our approach in finding better fragmentation schemas with improved performance.
