Image captioning involves generating an image description,
which includes identifying important objects and their relation-
ships and creating syntactically and semantically correct sen-
tences. This task requires collaboration between the computer
vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) research
communities [1] [2]. The large volume of unannotated images
on the Internet has driven the automated image captioning pro-
cess [3]. Furthermore, advances in deep learning models have
significantly improved computer vision and natural language
processing capabilities [4] [5]. Fig.1 shows the general archi-
tecture of the image captioning model.
