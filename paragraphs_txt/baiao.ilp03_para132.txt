Due to the small amount of examples available, and to overcome the overfitting problem during training, we applied k-fold cross validation approach to split the input data into disjoint training and test sets and, within that, a t-fold cross-validation approach to split training data into disjoint training and tuning sets [26, 21]. The revision algorithm monitors the error with respect to the tuning set after each revision, always keeping around a copy of the theory with the best tuning set accuracy, and the saved "best-tuning-set-accuracy" theory is applied to the test set. The experimental methodology built in FORTE, which is currently a random resampling, was adapted to follow the one above.
