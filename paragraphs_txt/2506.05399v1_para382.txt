In a study by [116], a novel image captioning technique
called Dynamic Attention Prior (DY-APR) was introduced. This
approach combines attention distribution before the local lin-
guistic context for dynamic attention aggregation. The researchers
proposed a method for dynamically aggregating the Attention
Distribution Prior (ADP) and the current layerâ€™s attention score
to provide more precise attention guidance. They also presented
a learning technique to gradually transition input tokens from a
fully static representation based on word embedding to a mixed
scheme incorporating both the input tokens and the linguistic
context.
