Machine learning was a result of the quest for mimicking human intelligence.  It has received tremendous amounts of attention in artificial intelligence research. [1] examines various approaches to machine learning, and classifies the approaches under three broad categories: (i) data mining, (ii) neural network and (iii) reinforcement learning techniques.  Learning is applied to a variety of domains such as spam filtering [2,3] and games [10]. [2] describes SpamAssassin, which is a mail filter that uses text analysis, Bayesian filtering, DNS blocklists, and collaborative filtering databases.  A part of our experimental database was from [2].
