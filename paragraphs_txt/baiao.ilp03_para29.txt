The set of heuristics implemented by the DDODB heuristic module may be further automatically improved by executing a theory revision process through the use of inductive logic programming (ILP) [27, 29, 34]. This process is called Theory REvisioN on the Design of Distributed Databases (TREND3). The improvement process may be carried out by providing two input parameters to the TREND3 module: the Prolog implementation of the analysis algorithm (representing the initial theory, or the background knowledge) and fragmentation schemas with previously known performances (representing a set of examples). The analysis algorithm is then automatically modified by a theory revision system (called FORTE) so as to produce a revised theory. The revised theory will represent an improved analysis algorithm that will be able to output a fragmentation schema with improved performance, and this revised analysis algorithm will then substitute the original one in the DDODB heuristic module. In [26], it has been pointed out that machine learning algorithms that use background knowledge, thus combining inductive with analytical mechanisms, obtain the benefits of both approaches: better generalization accuracy, smaller number of required training examples, and explanation capability.
