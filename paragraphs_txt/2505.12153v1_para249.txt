The federated aggregator performs a weighted aggregation
directly on the encrypted data using the additive homomor-
phic property, computing the global encrypted parameters as
Enc(θglobal) = (cid:80)N
ni
n Enc(θi). Here, N represents the total
number of hospitals, ni is the number of training samples
at hospital i, and n is the total number of training samples
across all hospitals. After aggregation, decryption occurs only
at the trusted global server using the private key sk, such that
θglobal = HE.Decsk (Enc(θglobal)), where HE.Dec denotes
the homomorphic decryption function. Finally, the decrypted
global model parameters θglobal are securely distributed back
to all local hospitals, completing the federated training round,
i.e., Server → Hospitals : θglobal.
