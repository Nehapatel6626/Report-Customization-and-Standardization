Learning, being one of the most prominent fields of artificial Intelligence research, has been extensively worked on.  The learning component of a system allows it to automatically learn from the environment and modify its behavior. This is different from the conventional notion of a deterministic program.  Learning techniques have been employed in a wide range of domains.  Current spam filtering systems [2] and the worldâ€™s best computer backgammon player [10] employ learning.
