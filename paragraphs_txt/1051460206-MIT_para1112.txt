In  Figure  4-6, the accuracy  of each class  is shown during  the training of the  CNN.
Specifically,  as the  CNN  is trained, the validation  dataset  is intermittently  used  to determine the
predictive  power of the  CNN.  As can be  seen, the  CNN  achieves  the highest accuracy  when
classifying  the bacteria,  probably  due to  the unique  shape of the  E. Coli.  The  CNN  achieves the
lowest  accuracy  for the classes that have  significant  intra-class  variability, including  "Other",
"Cast"  and "Squamous  Epithelial"  classes.  The  confusion matrix provides  a visual representation
of the  CNN's misclassifications.  For the confusion matrix,  we  use the average  results  for the
final  few validation  batches.
