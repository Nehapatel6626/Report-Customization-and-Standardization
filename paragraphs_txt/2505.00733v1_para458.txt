The overhead for both approaches can be seen in Table 7. Although it is not possible to make a
straightforward comparison between the development efforts of both approaches using the observed
overheads since the difficulty of modeling an element using the different modeling techniques is subjective,
analyzing the reason for the observed overheads provides insights for comparing the development efforts
of both approaches.
