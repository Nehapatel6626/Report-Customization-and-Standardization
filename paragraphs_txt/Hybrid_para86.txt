We have discussed, implemented and analyzed decision trees and the na√Øve Bayes approach to machine learning.  We discussed problems with such learning techniques.  Optimizations, such as cross validation, ensembles and pruning, to eliminate problems such as over-fitting, were discussed and implemented.
