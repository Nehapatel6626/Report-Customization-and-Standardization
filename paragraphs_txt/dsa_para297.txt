In general case, node to be removed is always located between two list nodes. Head and tail links are not updated in this case.
We need to know two nodes "Previous" and "Next", of the node which we want to delete.
Such a removal can be done in two steps: 
Update next link of the previous node, to point to the next node, relative to the removed node. 
Dispose removed node.
