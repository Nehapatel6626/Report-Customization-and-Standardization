The work of [94] introduced a text-to-picture system com-
prising several steps: keyword extraction, query formulation,
image selection, image captioning, sentence similarity, image
ranking, and image evaluation. This work identified challenges
in mapping natural text to multimedia, including a lack of cap-
tions and meaningful tags for images returned from the Google
search engine. To address this issue, they proposed using a
deep-learning captioning model.
