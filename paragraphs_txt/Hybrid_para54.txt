This classifier is parameterized by the Ï‡-value used for cut-off. If it is very high, then there exists no attribute that will give an information gain sufficient to split even the root node; making the root node itself as the Naive-Bayesian leaf node. On the other hand, if the cut-off is zero, then we get exactly the same tree as is constructed by Decision Trees. Moreover, getting a zero information gain upon choosing any attribute means that the number of that all instances in the leaf node belong to the same class, in which case, the Naive Bayesian leaf node will just return the class that the leaf  would have returned in a Decision Tree.
