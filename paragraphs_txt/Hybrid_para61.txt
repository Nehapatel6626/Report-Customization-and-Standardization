The cost of misclassifying is not symmetric in classifying spam – false positives are more expensive than false negatives. In order to tune the performance of the classifier, we study the effect of varying λ on the number of false positives and negatives. As expected, as λ grows, the number of false positives decreases, while the number of false negatives increases. Unfortunately, their sum (the total number of misclassifications) also increases – growing to almost 200 (11%) by the time the number of false positives comes down to 0.
