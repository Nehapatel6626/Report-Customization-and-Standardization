This thesis presents an in-depth investigation on characterization of optical fiber preform
core manufacturing and the identification of underlying trends in measured production data.
While walking through the different operations involved in the process, we explained the chal-
lenges associated with insuring refractive index profile precision and glass purity. Starting
with unsupervised learning, process by process, we applied linear and non linear dimensional-
ity reduction algorithms (PCA and t-sne) to features matrices created from time series data
and have been able to connect data clusters with context information like machines or month
of the year. Then considering the core fabrication process as a whole, we studied the propa-
gation of trends in the data sets up to quality measurements using Diceâ€™s statistic to gauge
similarities between samples sets. Finally, we developed some data-driven regression models
in order to predict the refractive index measured at the end using data from all processes.
As a result, Kernel algorithms performed the best and almost as well on raw statistics from
all processes as on encoded information about machine sequences and dates. This super-
vised approach demonstrated some great potential for the development of prediction tools
which could help design the optimized production line. An underlying objective is to support
Sterlite Technologies Limited in using data-driven approach applied to process control for its
plant in Waluj and Shendra starting by implementing good practices for variables measure-
ment, logging and tracking.
