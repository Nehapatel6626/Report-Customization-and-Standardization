The Fundamental Domain Theory. The FDT file contains one clause for each of the attributes and relations used in the examples (which are defined in the DAT file through the predicate example/4, explained later), plus one clause for each object type. Given a database schema and a set of applications, then objects, their attributes and the relations between objects are fixed and represent all the information that is needed by the analysis algorithm, and therefore need not be revised.
