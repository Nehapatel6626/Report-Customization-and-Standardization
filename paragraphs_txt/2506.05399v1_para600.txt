|T (G (S r))|
where G(c) is the scene graph of the candidate sentence,
G(r j) is the scene graph of each reference sentence, G(S r) is the
scene graph of all reference sentences, O(c) is set of objects in
the candidate sentence, E(c) is set of attributes in the candidate
sentence, K(c) is set of relations in the candidate sentence, T is
the function that allows us to return logical tuples.
