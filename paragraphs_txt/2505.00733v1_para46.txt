The LAAS architecture (Alami et al., 1998) is an example of a three-layered architecture consisting
of a functional layer, an executive, and a decision layer. The functional layer contains the robotâ€™s
control and perception algorithms. The executive layer receives a task plan from the decision layer
and selects functions from the functional layer to realize each action in the task plan. The decision
layer includes a planner that generates task plans and a supervisor responsible for monitoring
plan execution and triggering replanning when necessary. More recent examples of layered robot
architectures include AEROSTACK (Sanchez-Lopez et al., 2016), designed for aerial drone swarms, and
SERA (Garcia et al., 2018), which is tailored for decentralized and collaborative robots. These architectures
build on the layered model but focus on providing domain-specific solutions.
