The Indonesian dataset used in the study by [81] is FEEH-
ID, which contains 8,099 images, each paired with five captions
in Indonesian. The images were sourced from Flickr. The first
6,000 images from the training set were selected for their ex-
periments. The captions were generated using a combination
of Google Translate and manual translation by a professional
English-Indonesian translator. The total vocabulary size of the
dataset varied depending on the frequency of objects appearing
in the images.
