same as  the per particle  accuracy  that we will  later use  to characterize  algorithm performance.
Figure  5-4  shows the per pixel  accuracy across  training  cycles.  Although the system  seems  to
plateau rapidly,  it's critical  to  allow the FCN  to train  to completion.  The performance  gains in
accurately  identifying  particles  are  significant as we  increase  the per pixel  accuracy  from  98% to
+99%.  As can  be  seen  in Figure  5-5,  this +1%  increase  in per-pixel  accuracy  changes the
predicted output  from foreground blobs  interspersed  with background  pixels to  filled foreground
circles.
