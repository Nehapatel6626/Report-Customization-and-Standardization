Over the last few years, cyber attacks have become increasingly sophisticated.
an eﬀort to defend themselves, corporations often look to machine learning, aiming
to use the large amount of data collected on cyber attacks and software systems
to defend systems at scale. Within the ﬁeld of machine learning in cybersecurity,
PDF malware is a popular target of study, as the diﬃculty of classifying malicious
ﬁles makes it a continuously eﬀective method of attack. The obstacles are many:
Datasets change over time as attackers change their behavior, and the deployment
of a malware detection system in a resource-constrained environment has minimum
throughput requirements, meaning that an accurate but time-consuming classiﬁer
cannot be deployed. Recent work has also shown how automated malicious ﬁle cre-
ation methods are being used to evade classiﬁcation.
