Sample Generation The samples were extended by 0.2 seconds at both the
beginning and the end to ensure that no utterances were inadvertently cut off due
to inaccuracies in the rounded timestamps. Each sample was assigned a random
identifier and automatically supplemented with metadata, including details such
as the broadcast station, speaker gender, and its position (index) within the
entire broadcast. A detailed description of each available attribute is provided
in Table 2. This data was obtained from the original metadata accompanying
the raw audio data.
