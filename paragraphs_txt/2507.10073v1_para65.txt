Limitations in Cultural Representation Our findings raise questions about the validity
of using LLMs as synthetic populations in social science research. While previous work has
suggested that LLMs can accurately simulate human response distributions [argyle2023out],
our cross-cultural analysis reveals critical limitations to this approach. The observed ho-
mogenization effect means that synthetic populations generated by current LLMs may
systematically under-represent cultural diversity, potentially leading to misleading conclu-
sions in cross-cultural research. This limitation is particularly concerning given the growing
interest in using synthetic populations to overcome practical and ethical challenges in
human subjects research. Our findings suggest that researchers should exercise caution when
using LLM-generated synthetic populations, particularly for cross-cultural research or when
