Furthermore, with the MS COCO dataset, techniques such
as [79] and [77] demonstrate strong performance, scoring highly
in the BLEU and CIDEr metrics, showcasing their effective-
ness in generating diverse and accurate captions. However,
achieving high performance on non-English datasets such as
Bengali BORNON and Indonesian FEEH-ID is more challeng-
ing, underscoring the need for further research and develop-
ment in multilingual and culturally diverse image captioning
techniques. This variation underscores the importance of cre-
ating more inclusive datasets and methods that perform well in
linguistic and cultural contexts.
