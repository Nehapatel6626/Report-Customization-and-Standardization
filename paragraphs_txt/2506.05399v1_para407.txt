age captioning
This section evaluates the effectiveness of various state-of-
the-art methods for Image Captioning, as presented in Table 2.
The table includes numerous methods used on different datasets,
including Arabic datasets such as Flickr8k and Flickr30k and
English datasets like Flickr8k, Flickr30k, and MSCOCO, along
with other datasets from various languages. Performance was
measured using several metrics, including CIDEr, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, SPICE, and BLEU scores at four levels (BLEU-1
through BLEU-4). Upon a thorough examination, it is evident
that the technique [55] achieved a high BLEU-1 score of 0.658
when applied to the Flickr8k Arabic dataset using manual ex-
traction. Compared to non-English datasets, methods applied
