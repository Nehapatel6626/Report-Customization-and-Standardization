The work by [58] introduced the Arabic Flickr8K dataset.
To create this dataset, the original English Flickr8K dataset
was translated into Arabic using a two-phase process: First,
the Google Translate API produced an initial Arabic transla-
tion. Next, qualified Arabic translators carefully reviewed and
refined the translations. After verification, the top three transla-
tions per image were selected from an initial pool of five. The
final Arabic Flickr8K dataset consisted of 6,000 training im-
ages, 1,000 validation images, and 1,000 test images, each with
three unique captions.
