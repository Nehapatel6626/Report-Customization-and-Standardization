We used different sizes of OpenAIâ€™s Whisper8 model for our fine-tuning experi-
ments. Whisper is an open-source multilingual transformer [29] model designed
for automatic speech recognition, translation, and language detection [24]. It
was trained on an extensive multilingual corpus collected through web crawling.
Thanks to its internal segmentation, Whisper can transcribe audio of arbitrary
length [24].
