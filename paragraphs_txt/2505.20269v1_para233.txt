On the other hand, Figure 3 depicts comparable results between both
encodings for ANNs with two hidden layers. Moreover, similar standard
deviations were achieved for both encodings, indicating comparable levels of
consistency in performance. The variability increases significantly with more
complex networks. For example, with 35 and 40 neurons per layer, both
encodings exhibit significant variability. Furthermore, with 30 neurons per layer,
our adaptation shows higher variability compared to the other approach.
