Abstract. Domain-specific chatbot applications often involve multi-step interactions, such as refining search filters, 
selecting  multiple  items,  or  performing  comparisons.  Traditional  graphical  user  interfaces  (GUIs)  handle  these 
workflows by providing explicit “Submit” (commit data) and “Reset” (discard data) actions, allowing back-end 
systems to track user intent unambiguously. In contrast, conversational agents rely on subtle language cues, which 
can  lead  to  confusion  and  incomplete  context  management.  This  paper  proposes  modeling  these  GUI-inspired 
metaphors—acknowledgment  (submit-like)  and  context  switching  (reset-like)—as  explicit  tasks  within  large 
language model (LLM) prompts. By capturing user acknowledgment, reset actions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) 
reasoning as structured session data, we preserve clarity, reduce user confusion, and align domain-specific chatbot 
interactions  with  back-end  logic.  We  demonstrate  our  approach  in  hotel  booking  and  customer  management 
scenarios, highlighting improvements in multi-turn task coherence, user satisfaction, and efficiency.
