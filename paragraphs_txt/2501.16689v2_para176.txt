The mission of the meta-planner MP is to construct a plan-
ner that generates an actionable workﬂow for a given task.
It does so by analyzing task objectives, identifying roles
and constraints, and organizing agents into a structured ex-
ecution plan. This three-phase approach ensures that every
agent and dependency is optimally placed, reﬁned, and val-
idated, leading to robust, task-speciﬁc workﬂows.
