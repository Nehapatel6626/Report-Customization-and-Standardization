SDS-200 The SDS-200 dataset [21] comprises 200 hours of spoken audio recorded
by approximately 4000 speakers. However, the number of recordings varies signif-
icantly among speakers, following a long-tail distribution. The test set contains
5 hours of audio. An online service was utilized in which speakers were presented
with a Standard German sentence to be spoken in their respective Swiss German
dialects. To ensure quality, the recordings were validated by other participants.
The sentences were selected from Swiss newspapers and the Standard German
dataset of the Common Voice corpus.3 The sample durations range from 2.0 s to
11.2 s, with an average duration of 4.8 s.
