Further analysis of the results (see Figure 4) revealed that all dialects in the
training data benefited from the fine-tuning, despite a significant variance in
the quantity of training data available for the different broadcasting stations,
which ranged from less than 2 hours to over 11 hours (ref. Table 9). Also, the
broadcasting stations with no training data improved significantly (marked with
a star in Figure 4).
