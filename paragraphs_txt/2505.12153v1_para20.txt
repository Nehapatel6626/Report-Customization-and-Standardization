Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising dis-
tributed learning paradigm that addresses the privacy chal-
lenges associated with centralized RL training. FL enables
collaborative model training across multiple geographically
distributed hospitals or healthcare institutions without the need
for direct sharing of sensitive patient data [17]â€“[19]. In FL,
each participating institution trains AI models locally on its
private dataset. Subsequently, instead of sharing raw data,
institutions share only aggregated model updates, such as
gradients or parameter differentials, with a central server or
aggregator. This process preserves data privacy and security by
ensuring that sensitive patient information remains within the
confines of individual institutions. Consequently, FL promotes
robust collaborative learning across diverse clinical environ-
ments while mitigating privacy risks.
