For each available policy, surgical performance metrics are
computed based on task-specific benchmarks. When multiple
hospitals contribute policies for the same surgical task, the
policy with the highest performance score, evaluated through
cumulative reward, is dynamically selected. This ensures that
the most suitable policy is deployed in real-time within RAS
systems.
