Although Swiss German is not officially included in Whisperâ€™s training data,
we, along with other researchers, have identified indications of Swiss broadcasts
in the training data [28]. This observation is supported by some hallucinated
outputs generated by the Whisper models. This may help explain why Whisper
models performed surprisingly well in several zero-shot experiments involving
Swiss German transcription [7,26,28].
