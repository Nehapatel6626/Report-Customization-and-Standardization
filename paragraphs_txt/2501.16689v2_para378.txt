By combining these OR techniques with agent-based sys-
tems, the validation protocol ensures comprehensive and
adaptive checks for workï¬‚ow consistency. Future work can
explore integrating heuristic methods, such as genetic algo-
rithms or simulated annealing, to further enhance recovery
processes.
