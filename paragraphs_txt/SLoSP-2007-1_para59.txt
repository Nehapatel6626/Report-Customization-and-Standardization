Proposed simple structural factors
Right association (Kimball 1973) = ‘low’ or ‘near’ attachment = ‘early closure’ (of NP)
Minimal attachment (Frazier 1978). Effects depend on grammar, but gave ‘high’ or ‘distant’ attachment = ‘late closure’ (of NP) under the assumed model
Which is right?
Such simple structural factors dominated in early psycholinguistics (and are still widely invoked).
In the V NP PP context, right attachment usually gets right 55–67% of cases.
But that means it gets wrong 33–45% of cases.
