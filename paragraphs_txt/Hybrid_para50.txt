A side-effect of using the information-gain heuristic which we exploit is that if there are two attributes dependent on each other, then we can hope that one of them would be chosen to split a node of the decision tree. As a result, for attributes left in the leaf nodes, it would be more acceptable to make the independence assumption (that when all attributes were considered together), as other attributes that some of the attributes in the leaves were dependent on, would have been selected higher up in the tree to split a node.
