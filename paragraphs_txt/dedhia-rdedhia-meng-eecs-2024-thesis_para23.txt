In this study, I present a browser extension designed to sanitize all downloaded CSV
files by eliminating any harmful code while preserving the integrity of benign code. The
extension does this by first finding all formulas within a CSV file, and determining whether
or not each one has the potential to contain malicious code. If the extension determines that
a formula may be malicious, it will edit the cell containing that formula so that spreadsheet
programs will interpret the cell as text, and will not execute it.
