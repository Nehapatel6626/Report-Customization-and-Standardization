Key Insight: In a typical GUI, Submit commits the data the user has entered, while Reset discards it, returning to a 
default or initial state. We replicate this idea in the chatbot context by designing specialized prompts that explicitly 
label user intentions. For example, when a user appears to confirm a specific customer, we interpret that as a Submit-
like action. Conversely, when the user wants to abandon the current customer or switch to a new one, we treat it as a 
Reset-like action.
