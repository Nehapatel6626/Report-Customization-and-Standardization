The language model used to generate the sentences should emulate the general structure of the words found in the text corpora.  Such a model is derived from examining the occurrences of word pairs in the text sources.  A probabilistic model is derived from those counts and used in the sentence generation process.  The language model is used to assign probability values to sequences of word combinations that appear in the lattice.  The use of the Viterbi algorithm, with beam search, allows the system to discriminate and eliminate those word sequences that are deemed improbable according to the language model.  The use of a simple bigram model is amazingly effective in generating a collection of words that compose a sentence.  Previous work has shown that such a method will give comparable results when compared to higher order n-gram models [6].
