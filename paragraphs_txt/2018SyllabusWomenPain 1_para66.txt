Four Short Reflection Essays: Students will turn in FOUR short (1-2 pages) reflective essays reflecting on a book (or two books) from EACH topic area: Theodicy, Sex Differences, Women Worldwide, and Pain Management. In these essays students will discuss how the readings fit into their growing body of knowledge and understanding. Do not merely tell me what each author wrote. I have already read the books! Explore the significance of the readings as they affect your own thinking and ministry to women in pain. Use at least 10 of the following reflective / descriptive verbs like “I think,” “I wonder,” “I consider,” “I am confused by,” “I am touched by,” “My thinking is transformed by,” “I do not believe,” “I agree with,” “I disagree with,” “X caught my attention,” “X struck me.” An essay is NOT a research paper objectively laying out data with footnotes, etc.  Instead, these are short (1-2 pages) reflective essays exploring the assigned readings and reflecting on them as you grow in your awareness of the issues for women dealing with pain. An essay does not rely on citations of outside sources, but is personal and reflective.
