Note: As stated above, this is a ‘Tentative’ schedule of lecture topics. Some weeks may bleed into the previous or following weeks topics. Typically I will lead a lecture/discussion on the readings from the text for the first hour or so of class. This will be followed by discussions and presentations from you the students on either your research project or your abstracts.
