(CDM) conforming to a
is presented as a conceptual data model
particular case of the enhanced entity-relationship (EER)Thalheim (1993, 2000) model, an extension
of
that accounts for subclassing and higher-order
relationships, i.e., relations between relationships. The EER model captures information as entities,
relationships, and attributes. An entity is a “’thing’ which can be distinctly identified” Chen (1976),
a relationship is an association among entities or relationships, and an attribute represents a
property of an entity or relationship Thalheim (1993, 2000). In addition, entities and relationships
play a role in the relationships they are part of, which is identified by the label on the
arrows in Figure 2. This CDM was selected since it supports n-ary relationships, many-to-
many relationships, higher-order relationships, and attributes for both entities and relationships.
Section 6.1 details why these representation capabilities are relevant to the proposed model. The rules are
also described at a conceptual level as decision diagrams. Section 6.2 presents the details on how the
knowledge model and rules can be implemented and executed and runtime.
