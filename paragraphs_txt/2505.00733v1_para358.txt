To evaluate to what extent ROSA’s knowledge model can capture the knowledge required for TACA, it
was used to model the TACA scenarios presented by C´amara et al. (2020) and Braberman et al. (2017)10,
and we showcase how the captured knowledge can be exploited to enable TACA. The experimental setup
for both scenarios is not publicly available. Thus, it was not possible to apply ROSA at runtime to the
simulated environments they used.
