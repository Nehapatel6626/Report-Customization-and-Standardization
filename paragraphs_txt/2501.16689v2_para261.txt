Table 4 summarizes the detailed schedules documented
in Tables 12, 13, and 14, in Appendix E.8. DeepSeek
demonstrated superior scheduling efﬁciency by optimiz-
ing James’s airport wait time for Emily’s pickup, requir-
ing only two iterations. While GPT4o eventually pro-
duced a valid solution in three iterations, it created sub-
optimal travel patterns by having Michael make separate
trips. Claude’s solution, though feasible in two iterations,
included unnecessary travel between pickup tasks. This ex-
periment highlighted how MP’s explicit constraint speciﬁ-
cation and common-sense augmentation enabled consistent
performance improvement across different LLMs.
