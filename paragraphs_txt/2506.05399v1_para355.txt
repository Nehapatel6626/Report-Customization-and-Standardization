Remote sensing image captioning (RSI) aims to generate
descriptions of the information contained in RSIs automatically.
The multiscale information of RSIs encompasses the properties
and complex relationships of items of various sizes. The study
by [102] developed a new model based on the encoder-decoder
framework. In this model, ResNet50 serves as the encoder to
extract multi-scale information. At the same time, a multi-layer
aggregated transformer (MLAT) is employed in the decoder to
construct sentences using the extracted data effectively. Addi-
tionally, LSTM aggregates features from multiple transformer
encoding levels to enhance feature representations.
