In our proposal for computing explanations, constraints in Equations (9), (4)
and (5) represent the formula F . As in Section 3, an instance is a conjunction
C, and the associated prediction by the ANN is a formula E. Given an input
C predicted as class ci by the ANN, again formula ¬E must ensure that
(cid:87)N
j=1,j̸=i oi ≤ oj. Therefore, we must add new constraints to represent ¬E.
Maintaining the concept of the original encoding in [17] without implications,
we define these additional constraints accordingly. We employ binary variables
qj and the upper and lower bounds ubj and lbj of variables oj. As for lbl
i and ubl
i,
we find the bounds ubj and lbj through a MILP solver. We recall such elements
