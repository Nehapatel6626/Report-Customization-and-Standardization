The process of image captioning starts with an input im-
age. The next step is image processing, which involves resiz-
ing, normalizing, and augmenting the image. This is followed
by feature extraction using CNN architectures like ResNet or
Inception, which encode the features into a fixed-size vector. In
the language processing stage, models like RNN, LSTM, GRU,
or Transformer convert words into vectors and predict the next
word in the sequence. The attention mechanism selectively fo-
cuses on different parts of the image to enhance the captioning
process. Finally, in the output stage, a descriptive caption is
generated. For example, ”A little girl in a pink dress going into
a wooden cabin.” This architecture effectively combines com-
puter vision and natural language processing to automatically
