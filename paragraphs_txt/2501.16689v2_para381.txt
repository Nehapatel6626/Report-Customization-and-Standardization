While the state space dimensions—Who, Where, When,
What, and Why—are broad enough to cover diverse do-
mains, additional customization may be required for unique
applications. This section examines how MACI generalizes
across domains like ﬁnancial planning, healthcare logistics,
and supply chain optimization. The travel planning ex-
ample is illustrative, emphasizing how MACI dynamically
adapts state spaces and agents to domain-speciﬁc require-
ments.
