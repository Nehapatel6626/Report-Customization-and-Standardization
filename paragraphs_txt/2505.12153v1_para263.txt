Fig. 4 presents the impact of DP noise standard deviation on
both Accuracy and Privacy Effectiveness in a FL environment.
The x-axis represents increasing levels of noise added for DP,
ranging from 0.01 to 1.00, effectively capturing the spectrum
of privacy protection strength. The heatmap highlights the
inverse relationship between these two metrics as the noise
standard deviation increases, Privacy effectiveness improves,
