The results obtained are shown in Table 6. The different managed subsystems had similar performance
despite the difference in their reaction time. Furthermore, since the performance with ROSA was better
than without a managing subsystem and close to the other managing subsystems, it can be considered as
additional evidence of the feasibility of applying it at runtime to enable self-adaptation in robotic systems.
