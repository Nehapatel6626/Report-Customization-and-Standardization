Students are expected to attend all classes and to participate actively. Students will discuss all absences with the instructor. Students will complete all assignments ON TIME. If life intervenes to prevent you from turning in an assignment on time, I will honor your prioritization of your life over schoolwork and the grade penalty is 1 point per day including weekends with no late assignment accepted more than 1 week late. Walker Percy said, “You can get straight A’s and flunk life.” Choose life and incur the grade penalty.
