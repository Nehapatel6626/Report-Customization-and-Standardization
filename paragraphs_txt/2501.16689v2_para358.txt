The protocol begins with pre-validation. Before a state tran-
sition starts, the validation agent queries relevant agents
about preconditions. For a travel booking, temporal agent
veriﬁes the proposed times ﬁt within existing schedules.
Spatial agent conﬁrms the physical feasibility of move-
ments between locations. Role agent checks if all actors
can perform their assigned functions.
