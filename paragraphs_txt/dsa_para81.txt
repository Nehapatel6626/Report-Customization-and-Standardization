To implement an ADT, you need to choose:
A data representation
must be able to represent all necessary values of the ADT
should be private
An algorithm for each of the necessary operation: 
must be consistent with the chosen representation
all auxiliary (helper) operations that are not in the contract should be private 
Remember: Once other people are using it
Itâ€™s easy to add functionality
