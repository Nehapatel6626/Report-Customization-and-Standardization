Mnemonic devices are useful memory aids that can be applied to many different aspects of daily life.  There are always certain tidbits of information that people just canâ€™t seem to remember in the form they are presented.  People rely on mnemonics when they create some association between that information they wish to remember and other concepts that they already know, or find easier to remember.  There are countless types of associations possible for fulfilling this purpose.  People will tend to rely on the technique they feel will more easily enable them to recall the information they want at a later time.
