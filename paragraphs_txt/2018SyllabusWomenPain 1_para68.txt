A case study is the collection and presentation of detailed information about a particular person or small group, frequently including the accounts of subjects themselves. 1) Write a case study about a woman (who could be you!) dealing with the area of pain you selected during the first class and how you ministered to her or how you were ministered to. 2) Look back and reflect on what you could have done differently or what you would have liked to have been done differently. 3) Then offer a well-developed and well-researched model for intervening with a woman suffering that type of pain. 4) Include an annotated bibliography. A bibliographic annotation is a short paragraph telling the reader what was valuable (or not valuable) in the books / articles you read. For the case study, the following should be included.
