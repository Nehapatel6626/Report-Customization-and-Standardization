Effectiveness on different packers. Here, we zoom in on the results obtained
from the best configuration in the previous experiment, namely the one with 100
samples for packers. The test set is the remaining part of the dataset. Table 3
shows that PackHero performs very well on each packer in the dataset. We
have a near-maximum accuracy in general and equally good results in all other
metrics for other packers. The only exception is tElock, which is found to have
a higher FPR than the others. This result has chain effects on precision and
F1-score. An answer can be found by looking at the clusters’ composition. In
particular, tElock produces two clusters of 1 and 99 samples. In its current
version, PackHero merges single-sample clusters with the nearest one. As a result,
for tElock, we obtain a single cluster consisting mostly of similar samples, along
with one slightly different sample, which lowers intra-cluster similarity. This
leads to a reduced threshold (≈ 0.10 lower than others) and lower confidence
