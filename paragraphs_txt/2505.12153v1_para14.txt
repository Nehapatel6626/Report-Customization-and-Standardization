capabilities. RL empowers autonomous agents, in this case,
surgical robots, to learn optimal sequences of actions through
iterative interaction with a dynamic environment, guided by
reward signals [5]. RL algorithms, when utilizing real-time
intraoperative information alongside historical procedural data,
can empower surgical robots to enhance their control strate-
gies, customize interventions to suit each patientâ€™s unique
in
anatomical and physiological characteristics, and adjust
real-time to the unpredictable and variable nature of surgical
procedures [6], [7]. This capability is crucial for navigating
the nuanced and often complex landscape of surgical inter-
ventions.
