As the number of attributes increases, it clearly is not possible to use the na√Øve technique. This is due to the explosion of nodes if we branch on every attribute.  For example, if we have 20 binary attributes, then the total number of leaf nodes alone would be 220. The chi square value [9] is used as a means of testing for statistical significance.  The attribute that is to be chosen for branching is usually chosen by trying to maximize on the amount of information gain.
