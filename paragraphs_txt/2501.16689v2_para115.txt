Diagnosis: Attention Narrowing Claude detects con-
straint violations in other LLMs’ plans but both GPTo4 and
DeepSeek struggle with self-validation, revealing an asym-
metry in error detection. LLMs often embed ﬂawed inter-
pretations of constraints during planning (e.g., rigidly inter-
preting “someone must be in the house” when the turkey is
in the oven), propagating errors through their frameworks.
