We compared  the relative  counts from  the  medical laboratory  to the  relative  counts from
the reference  results for RBCs and WBCs for the  3  solutions  (see  Figure  6-8).  If there  is a  1-to- 1
relationship  between the  reference results  and the medical  laboratory  results, then we  expect  all
the data points to fall  on the linear  identity line.  Since the medical  laboratory  results are given in
ranges,  we  expect the  linear identity  line to transect these linear ranges.  This is the case for  all
medical  laboratory  results, including  the RBCs  (red markers)  and WBCs  (white markers).  Thus,
we conclude  that the  reference  results  are  accurate within the ranges  provided  by the medical
test,  and can be  used to validate  the  AutoScope results.
