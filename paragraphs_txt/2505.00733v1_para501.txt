In conclusion, given Assumptions 1 and 2, the total overhead per action can be defined as 10 + 6 ∗
nsa + 3 ∗ npa, where nsa and npa represent the number of structural and parameter adaptations for the
action, respectively. This indicates that the ROSA model grows linearly with the number of actions and
adaptations, which is made possible by the clear separation of the task and adaptation logic.
