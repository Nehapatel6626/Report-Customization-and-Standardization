Section 2 provides an overview of the most common speech corpora for Swiss
German and the SOTA STT models trained with these datasets. In Section 3,
we discuss the details of these datasets and highlight their limitations, as well as
the limitations of the SOTA models in real-world transcription tasks. Section 4
presents the specifics of the new SRB-300 speech corpus and the methodology
used for its collection. In Section 5, we explain how we fine-tuned various Ope-
nAI Whisper models using SRB-300 for practical applications in low-resource
languages, specifically Swiss German. Finally, Section 6 compares the perfor-
mance of the different fine-tuned Whisper models against other SOTA models
on the new SRB-300 corpus.
