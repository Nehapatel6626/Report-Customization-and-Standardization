The fragmentation schema is composed of the choice of a fragmentation technique and the definition of a set of fragments for each class of the database schema. The two basic fragmentation techniques to be applied on a class are horizontal and vertical fragmentation [28]. Vertical fragmentation breaks the class logical structure (its attributes and methods) and distributes them into fragments. Horizontal fragmentation distributes class instances across the fragments. Thus, a horizontal fragment of a class contains a subset of the whole class extension. Horizontal fragmentation is usually subdivided into primary and derived horizontal fragmentation. Primary horizontal fragmentation basically optimizes selection and projection operations, while derived horizontal fragmentation addresses the relationships between classes and improves performance of navigation operations. It is also possible to apply both vertical and primary horizontal fragmentation techniques to a class simultaneously (which we call hybrid fragmentation) or to apply different fragmentation techniques to different classes in the database schema (which we call mixed fragmentation).
