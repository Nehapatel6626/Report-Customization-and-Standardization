As image captioning technology advances, several future
challenges must be addressed to enhance its effectiveness. One
major challenge is improving the adaptability of captioning sys-
tems to diverse languages and cultural contexts. Current models
often struggle with non-English languages and culturally nu-
anced images, leading to less accurate or contextually relevant
captions. Another challenge is the need for more comprehen-
sive and inclusive datasets. Many existing datasets are limited
in scope or do not represent a wide range of cultural and contex-
tual variations, affecting the generalizability of captioning sys-
tems. Additionally, there is a growing need to develop models
that can understand and generate captions for complex, abstract,
or ambiguous images, where traditional methods may fall short.
Ensuring these systems can operate effectively in real-world
scenarios, including understanding user-specific contexts and
preferences, is also crucial.
