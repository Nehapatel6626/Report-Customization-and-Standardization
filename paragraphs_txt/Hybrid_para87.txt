A novel hybrid approach to machine learning was also presented.  The hybrid approach produces a spectrum of solutions that can be used to learn.  At one end of the spectrum lies the naïve Bayes approach, while at the other end lies the decision tree approach.  All points elsewhere in the spectrum constitute of a decision tree with a naïve Bayes model at the leaf nodes.  This hybrid approach provides excellent learners for domains with a large number of dependent attributes.  The large number of attributes would make the domain not suited to decision trees, while naïve Bayes will not work well either due to the lack of independence amongst attributes.
