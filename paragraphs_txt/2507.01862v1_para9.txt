Q3: How do Large Language Models (LLMs) come into play? 
A3:  LLMs  can  generate  text  (including  structured  data,  such  as  XML  tags)  based  on  prompts.  In  traditional 
programming workflows, developers can prompt an LLM to produce specific variables or tags, parse these outputs, 
and  then  feed  them  back  into  the  applicationâ€™s  logic  [3].  This  creates  a  bridge  between  the  flexibility  of  natural 
language and the clarity of explicit UI actions.
