where Ï€i represents individual policies trained for distinct
surgical procedures across federated nodes. One of the main
challenges in Federated Reinforcement Learning (F-RL) for
surgical robotics is how to select the best-performing model
from multiple locally trained policies. Since each hospital
trains its policy independently, the decision of which pol-
icy (or combination of policies) to deploy in real surgical
environments needs to be based on well-defined evaluation
metrics. Below, we define three key metrics for F-RL model
selection. Fig. 2 depicts the FDRL workflow, where hospitals
train local RL policies on private data with DP noise and
HE encryption. Encrypted updates are securely aggregated
by the FL aggregator and distributed as a global model. A
surgical robot evaluates policies using MSS, enabling adaptive
selection of the optimal RL policy for precision and privacy
in RAS.
