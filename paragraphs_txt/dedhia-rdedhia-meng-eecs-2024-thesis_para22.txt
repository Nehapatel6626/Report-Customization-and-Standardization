CSV injection occurs when an attacker injects malicious code into a CSV file, and this
code is executed when the file is opened in a spreadsheet program. This type of attack is
possible because most spreadsheet programs have a set of built-in functions that run auto-
matically when a CSV file is opened with the spreadsheet program. Given the widespread
usage of CSV files and programs that interpret those CSV files, the risk posed by such CSV
injection attacks is great.
