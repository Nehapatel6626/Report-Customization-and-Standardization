The chi value [18] was set at 0.5 for these experiments. The decision tree had a total of 13 erroneous predictions for the SMALL dataset, out of which all 13 were false negatives.  There were a total of 72 errors for the LARGE dataset with 41 of them being false negatives and the other 31 being false positives.   Figure 2 shows the curve that represents the change in the total number of errors with Ï‡ when the SMALL dataset was used.  The graph takes the shape
