Future work will clinically validate the robotic-assisted
surgery framework with real patient data and partner hos-
pitals, focusing on adaptability, generalization, and real-time
performance under healthcare regulations. Key improvements
target computational efficiency and latency using hardware-
efficient strategies like quantised models, edge computing, and
lightweight compression. In parallel, a critical direction will
explore formal verification techniques to rigorously validate
the correctness, safety, and privacy guarantees of the FL proto-
cols and policy adaptation mechanisms. This includes employ-
ing model checking and formal methods to analyse decision-
making sequences in high-assurance surgical settings, ensuring
that the learned policies conform to medical safety constraints
and privacy-preserving standards. Such verification methods
will further strengthen the frameworkâ€™s trustworthiness and
clinical readiness, especially for regulatory approval in safety-
critical applications. Additionally, security concerns related
to privacy attacks, adversarial robustness, and reconstruction
threats will be addressed. Scalability and personalization will
improve through hospital-specific model fine-tuning, ensuring
collaborative performance. The framework may also advance
to real-time patient monitoring and remote diagnostics, empha-
sizing energy efficiency for underserved areas. This project ad-
vances privacy-preserving, adaptive, secure AI-driven robotic
surgery, tackling key challenges in privacy, efficiency, and
clinical integration.
