Step (1) is simply the Bayes theorem and (2) is the Na√Øve Bayes assumption. The latter assumption is made because it is in general very difficult to learn P(x|y) for all x, and in contrast much easier to learn P(xi|y). For binomial attributes xi, this can be done by simply counting the number of occurrences in the training set S, of xi in each class y, and the number of instances in each class.
