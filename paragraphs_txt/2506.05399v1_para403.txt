Figure 14 illustrates the general architecture of the attention
model. This innovation has greatly enhanced image captioning,
allowing the algorithm to focus on important image aspects and
ignore redundant content. This model implements attention as
a weighted sum of encoder outputs. A CNN first processes the
image within the encoder-decoder framework, resulting in fea-
ture maps. Subsequently, the attention module assigns a weight
to each image pixel based on the feature maps and a hidden
state. These weights enable the decoder to generate words for
the output text while concentrating on the most pertinent parts
of the image.
