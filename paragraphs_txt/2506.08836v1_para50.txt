Extraction Each available MP4 recording from 29 radio and 10 TV stations
contained approximately 8-hour excerpts of a dayâ€™s radio and TV broadcast,
including non-speech sections, resulting in a total of about 1790 hours of audio.
In the first step, irrelevant parts, such as music, jingles, commercials, and re-
peated programs, were identified and removed from the recordings. Professionals
then manually labeled the remaining speech data with contextual metadata, in-
cluding details like speaker gender and type of broadcast. One-third of the data
comes from TV broadcasts, while two-thirds comes from radio (ref. Appendix A,
Table 6).
