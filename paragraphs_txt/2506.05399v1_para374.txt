Fig. 11 shows a general architecture of the transformer
model for image captioning.
It includes a feature extraction
model, typically a CNN, and a transformer for text genera-
tion. The transformer comprises an image encoder to learn self-
attended visual features and a caption decoder to generate the
caption from the attended visual features.
