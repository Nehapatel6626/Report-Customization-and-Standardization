The case study and model of intervention with annotated bibliography:  At the end of the first class session, students will choose an area of interest and will write about this topic. The paper must be typed and double-spaced. It should be no less than 8 pages and no more than 10 pages in length, NOT including the required annotated bibliography and any appendices you add. Students must include at least 5 sources in their bibliography. These sources must NOT be websites but published resources. Peer-reviewed journal articles and other recent publications represent the best resources. Students may use any standard thesis format (APA, Chicago Manual of Style, Turabian, etc.), but need to be consistent in their application of a standard format. MACO students must use APA style.
