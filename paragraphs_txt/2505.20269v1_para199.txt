In this section, we detail the experiments conducted to compare our proposal
against the encoding presented in [5]. Our evaluation consists of two main
experiments. In the first one, we compare the two encodings using 12 datasets.
In the second one, we conduct a detailed comparison using a single dataset. We
vary the architecture of the trained ANNs to explore the effect of the number of
layers and neurons. We evaluate the performance of each encoding in terms of
time for building logical constraints and time for computing explanations. We
explained all instances in a given dataset and calculated the average time and
standard deviation to compare times for computing explanations. In the other
case, given a trained ANN on a dataset, we built the logical constraints 10 times
and calculated the average time and standard deviation.
