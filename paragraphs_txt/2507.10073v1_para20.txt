AI alignment represents the congruence between artificial systemsâ€™ behaviors and human
values, expectations, and intentions. In the context of Large Language Models (LLMs),
alignment takes on a complex dimension as these systems attempt to replicate human-
like responses across diverse moral and ethical frameworks [shen2024towards]. True
alignment demands that AI systems not only produce outputs that superficially resemble
human responses but also demonstrate consistent understanding of the underlying moral
foundations that guide human decision-making across different cultural contexts. The concept
of alignment extends beyond mere technical performance to encompass moral and cultural
dimensions. While technical alignment ensures functionality within specified parameters,
moral alignment requires AI systems to represent and reason within ethical frameworks that
humans find acceptable across diverse cultural backgrounds. This multifaceted approach to
understanding AI alignment presents a sociotechnical challenge requiring interdisciplinary
solutions [cabrera2023ethical].
