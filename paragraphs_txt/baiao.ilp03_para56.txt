FORTE is a theory revision system, in the sense that it modifies incorrect knowledge by applying the "identify and repair" strategy. It performs a hill-climbing search in the hypothesis space, by applying revision operators (both specialization and generalization) to the initial domain theory in an attempt to minimally modify it in order to make it consistent with a set of training examples. By doing that, FORTE preserves as much of the initial theory as possible. Furthermore, revisions are developed and scored using the entire training set, rather than just a single instance, which gives FORTE a better direction than if revisions were developed from single instances. More details on the FORTE system may be found in [10, 29].
