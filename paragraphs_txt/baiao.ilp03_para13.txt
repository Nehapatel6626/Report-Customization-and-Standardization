There are approaches in the literature addressing the DDODB problem [4, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20, 24, 31]. However, none of them addresses the problem of choosing the most adequate fragmentation technique to be applied to each class of the database schema. Some works have been applying machine learning techniques to solve database problems. For example, [8, 9] present an approach for the inductive design of deductive databases, based on the database instances to define some intentional predicates. Also, relational bayesian networks were used to estimate query selectivity in a query processor [19] and to predict the structure of relational databases [18]. However, considering the design of distributed databases as an application for theory revision is a novel approach.
