Various kinds of approaches to enhance the performance of the above mentioned techniques exist.  These include boosting, cross-validation, and ensemble construction.  These techniques tend to solve the problem of over-fitting.  This would arise when a learning algorithm is too concerned and takes a narrow approach to learning based on the data set used for training.  This would lead to false predictions when the algorithm is allowed to predict on new unseen data.
