Figure 2 shows the geographic distribution of the broadcasting stations, and
Figure 3 the length distribution of the audio samples in the SRB-300 dataset.
To that end, the broadcasting stations were categorized into 10 dialect regions.
The diameters of the circles in Figure 2 represent the total duration of samples
collected from broadcast stations within each region. We have ensured that the
SRB-300 corpus is weighted to reflect the size of their speaker populations.6 Since
regional broadcasting stations generally feature local presenters and cater to local
listeners, we can assume that the dialects of the speakers closely align with the
locations of these stations. Therefore, we anticipate that the most prominent
Swiss dialects are well represented in the dataset. The green background in
Figure 2 indicates the approximate border of the Swiss German language in
Switzerland.7
