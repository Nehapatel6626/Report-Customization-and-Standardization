Recently, researchers at the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Dana Farber
Cancer Institute built a calculator that estimates risk of cancer based on genetic
mutations. The calculator requires a lot of high quality data from medical journals,
which is laborious to obtain by hand.
In this thesis, I automate the process of
obtaining medical abstracts from PubMed and develop a classifier that uses domain
knowledge to determine relevant abstracts. The classifier is very accurate (percent
correct = 0.898, F1 = 0.86, recall = 0.905), and is significantly better than the
majority baseline.
I explore an alternative model that exploits rationales within
abstracts, which could lead to an even greater accuracy. After determining relevant
abstracts, itâ€™s useful to find the size of the cohorts, which is an indicator for the quality
of the medical study. Hence, I built a classifier that can accurately extract cohort
sizes from abstracts (F1 = 0.883), and developed a strong baseline for distinguishing
gene carrier cohort sizes from noncarriers.
