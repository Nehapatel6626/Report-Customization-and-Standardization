leveraging edge computing and hardware
accelerators (e.g., Trusted Execution Environments (TEE),
FPGA, or ASIC) could substantially reduce HE-induced la-
tency, ensuring suitability for time-critical surgical applica-
tions. The simulations were executed on a high-performance
computing cluster equipped with multi-core Intel Xeon pro-
cessors and NVIDIA GPUs for accelerated deep-learning
computations. High-speed network connectivity was utilized
to simulate federated communication between hospital sites.
Each node was equipped with 32GB of RAM, ensuring
efficient execution of the simulations and accurate evaluation
of the frameworkâ€™s performance. This robust hardware setup
allowed us to conduct extensive experiments and analyze the
