The study by [112] introduced a new approach to address
the computational limitations of traditional attention mecha-
nisms in image captioning. The authors presented X-Linear
Attention Networks (X-LAN), which combine a linear atten-
tion module for improved computational efficiency and reduced
complexity with a non-linear module capturing more detailed
interactions and dependencies within the image. The study
