This  folder  contains scripts  to perform  other types of analyses needed  for my  Master's  thesis that
are not related  to classification  or segmentation  of particles.  For example,  modeling the
illumination  pattern of the Autoscope,  calculating  the end-to-end resolution  of the Autoscope
system,  etc.
