Table 17 depicts Claude’s plan. It violated a couple of con-
straints in the ﬁrst two attempts, but these were minor. For
instance, in the second trial, it planned for Michael’s round
trip to Grandma’s home to take 30 minutes. However, the
key is that Claude can recognize its own error and make
corrections in the next iteration.
