we  observe  the lowest accuracies  with white  blood cells, having  an average  final  accuracy  of
64%.  A  likely explanation  for this result is  the medium from  which we  obtain the white blood
cells  from.  Specifically,  the BA/F3  white  blood cells  are  obtained from a medium  (a culture
medium with  fetal bovine serum)  that includes  many contaminating  particles.  When labeling  the
WBCs,  it is difficult to differentiate  between  the actual  WBCs  and the  many contamination
particles.  Thus, the  WBC  labels will  have an  increased  amount  of human  error,  leading to a
system poorly  trained  in identifying  WBCs.  This  issue transfers  to later experiments  since  1)  the
CNN  is poorly trained  to  identify  WBCs  and 2) the the WBC  medium  introduces these
contamination  particles  in all future  experiments.  Figure 4-13  shows  an AutoScope  image  of the
WBC  reference  solution  with just WBCs.  In the zoomed  in image, we  can observe  WBCs
surrounded  by  contamination  particles  labeled as  others.  In this image,  the  'other'  particles  seem
more clear,  but some  are  ambiguous  to the  naked eye.
