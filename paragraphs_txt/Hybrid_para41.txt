Another method to limit over-fitting is the ensemble construction method.  This involves the construction of multiple learners, with each one contributing to every prediction.  The AdaBoost [19] algorithm was used for the purposes of ensemble construction in this paper.  This technique trains a learner based on the input training data.  It then evaluates the performance of the learner on the same training data.  The examples that were incorrectly predicted are then given a higher weight.  Learning takes place again, and the learner construction process concentrates more on the accuracy of examples that have a high weight.  This process carries on.  Each learner has a weight associated with it, and when a prediction is required, the output of each learner is then weighed appropriately and a final prediction formed.
