The Naive Bayes Classifier has been well-studied, even in the domain of spam. [11] advocates the use of specific domain knowledge to get better recall and precision. In the context of spam-classification, the authors manually identify about 20 non-phrasal domain specific features such as overemphasized punctuation, time of receiving, number of attachments, subject lines, etc. We use a similar set of rules (from [2]) to preprocess emails and parameterize them along 613 attributes. Along with [13], [11] does a detailed evaluation of Naïve Bayes-based spam classifiers. [12] proposes heuristics like Complement NB (to deal with skewed training data) and introducing weights (to deal with dependence) to improve the accuracy of Naïve Bayes text classifiers; however many of their heuristics assume multinomial attributes, which we already get rid off during our pre-processing stage. Finally, we implement in our Naïve Bayesian classifier many simple hacks suggested in [15-17] by authors out of practical experience of designing spam classifiers. These include setting priors, weighting to deal with skewed data, etc.
