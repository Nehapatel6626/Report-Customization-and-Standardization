as 1 minus the average risk per surgery, making Rmit an
increasing metric, where higher values indicate safer policy
performance. This method integrates numerous risk factors,
allowing for an objective and data-driven assessment of RL-
based surgical protocols, thereby facilitating the choice of
optimal, risk-conscious strategies for both autonomous and
semi-autonomous robotic operations.
