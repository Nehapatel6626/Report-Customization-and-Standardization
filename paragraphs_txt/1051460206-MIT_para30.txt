respect to urine  solutions composed  of RBCs,  WBCs,  and microbeads.  The  specificity  and
sensitivity was  determined  by  generating  209  digital urine  specimens modeled  after urine
received in  medical  labs.  The  Autoscope  had a  sensitivity  of 88%  and 91%  and a specificity  of
89% and 97% for RBCs  and WBCs,  respectively.  Next, we determined  the  Autoscope's  accuracy
by fabricating  8  synthetic  urine  samples  with RBCs,  WBCs and microbeads.  The  reference
results  were  confirmed through  a medical  laboratory.  The  AutoScope's  counts  and the  reference
counts were  linearly  correlated  to  each other  (r2= 0.980)  across  all particles.  The  sensitivity,
specificity,  and R-squared values  for the AutoScope  are  comparable  (and mostly better)  than the
same metrics  for the  iQ-200,  a $100,000-$150,000  state-of-the-art  semi-automated  urinalysis
system.
