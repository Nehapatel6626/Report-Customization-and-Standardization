We  will first introduce  the  standard  segmentation  algorithm.  In the standard  algorithm,
we  use  common image  segmentation  techniques  to  find particle  coordinates.  First, we  apply  an
adaptive  thresholding  algorithm to transform  the greyscale  image  to a  binary image.  Each  pixel
is labeled  as either a 0  (background)  or  1  (foreground).  Adaptive  thresholding  functions
determine  a new threshold  for each pixel based on the values  of the surrounding  pixel.  By  doing
this,  adaptive  thresholding takes  into  account  localized  variations,  for  example,  in the
illumination  of the image.  Second,  a connected  component analysis  is used  in order  to isolate
each group  of connected  foreground pixels.  For each connected  component  identified,  we
remove  components  with a  size below  4  foreground  pixels. This component  removal  technique
filters out stray  foreground  pixels,  and we  assume  the remaining  foreground pixels  map to  actual
particles.  Then,  in order to  combine  clumps  of particles  into  a  single  coordinate,  we use  the  close
operator  followed  by the  dilation  operator.  Finally, we  identify  the centroid  of each remaining
connected  component,  and  use this to  produce  a crop to  be  classified.
