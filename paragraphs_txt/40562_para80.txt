I do not have an office on the University Park campus.  However, students may schedule an appointment at my Health Science Alhambra office, which is located at 1000 S. Fremont Ave. Unit 8, Bldg 5, Rm 5229, Alhambra, CA 91803.  I am also available to meet with students following class.  Students may communicate with me via email, and I will attempt to respond to email inquires in a timely manner.
