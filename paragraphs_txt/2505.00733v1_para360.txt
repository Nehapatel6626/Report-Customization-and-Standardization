To evaluate the development effort of using ROSA to enable adaptation in robotic systems, we analyze
the number of elements contained in the ROSA model created to solve the use cases described in this paper.
Furthermore, we compare it to the number of elements modeled with the BT approach to solve the SUAVE
use case.
