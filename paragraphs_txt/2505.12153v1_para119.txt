In this context, d(st, st−1) represents the change in patient
state between consecutive time steps, while θ is a predefined
threshold used to determine whether a significant state change
has occurred. The indicator function I(d(st, st−1) > θ)
evaluates whether a notable state change has taken place, and
I(at ̸= at−1) checks whether the policy adjusted its decision
accordingly. A higher adaptation metric, denoted as αadapt,
indicates that the RL model is quickly adapting to new surgical
scenarios, enhancing its robustness for real-world deployment.
