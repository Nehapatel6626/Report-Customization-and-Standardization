Figure 9 depicts the pattern used to model SUAVEâ€™s search pipeline action and its related adaptations12.
As can be seen, there is no separation between the task and adaptation logic, which is the main limitation
of using BTs in comparison to using ROSA to model the adaptation logic. The coupling of both logics
hinders the reusability of the approach as another system with the same task logic but different adaptation
logic, or vice-versa, cannot reuse the existing BTs. In addition, when any changes are made to the task or
adaptation problems, it will most likely require changes to parts of the BT that are not necessarily related to
the changes introduced. Furthermore, it makes the modeling process more difficult as the roboticist needs
to consider both problems simultaneously when modeling the BTs.
