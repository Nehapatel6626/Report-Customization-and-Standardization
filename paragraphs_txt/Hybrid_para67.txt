This section evaluates the performance of ensembles and cross validation.  A na√Øve learner suffers from the problem of learning on a concentrated training set.  This narrow approach would imply that the performance of the learner on unseen data might be poor.  To avoid such over-fitting, we use techniques like ensembles and cross validation.  We evaluate these approaches for decision trees.
