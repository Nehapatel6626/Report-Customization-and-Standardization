Over-fitting [9] is often a problem for learners.  Given a set of training data, the learner would tend to take a narrow approach and learns such that its predictions for the given training set is accurate, while it fares poorly on unseen data.  This is usually due to either outliers or insufficient representation of the various classes in the data that misleads the construction of the learner.  Such a problem can be solved through a variety of approaches. The following subsections discuss a few: (i) cross-validation, (ii) ensemble and (iii) pruning.  Pruning is only relevant in the context of decision trees. [9] discusses all these approaches in greater detail.
