Principal 2 â€“ Precise Assumptions
Validation of the assumption
By there very nature assumptions/statements are not proven but conjectured . . . 
Comparison of schemes
If one scheme makes a weaker assumption than another then the first is to be preferred . . .  
Facilitation of proofs of security
If the security of a scheme cannot be proven unconditionally and must rely on an assumption then a mathematical proof that the construction is secure requires a precise definition of the statement.
