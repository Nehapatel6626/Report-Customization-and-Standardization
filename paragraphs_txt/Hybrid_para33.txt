Even in this basic form, the naïve bayes classifier performs reasonably well. Its biggest weakness though lies in the very assumption that makes it so simple – that the attributes are independent of each other. There have been many heuristics that have been proposed in the literature [Section 2] to improve the classifier’s performance in domains where the assumption leads to bad performance. Its other drawback is that it does not work well when the training data set is skewed, for instance when we get no training instance for a particular class. For such cases, as suggested in [15], we assign P(xi|y) = ε>0.
