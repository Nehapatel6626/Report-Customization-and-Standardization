Theoretically
abstract base class describes ADT
inherited implementations implement data structures
can change data structures transparently (to client code)
Practice
different implementations sometimes suggest different interfaces (generality vs. simplicity)
performance of a data structure may influence form of client code (time vs. space, one operation vs. another)
