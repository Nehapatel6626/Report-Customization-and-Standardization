In the experiments of this work, we considered all instances of the datasets
used, which considerably increased the experiments running time. As future
work, we can change the design of experiments, using only a subset of the
datasets, to allow the use of larger ANNs. More experiments are necessary,
especially with additional layers and neurons, to further validate our findings and
understand the performance of these encodings. Furthermore, others encodings
[9, 10] can be evaluated for computing logic-based minimal explanations for
ANNs. Moreover, in order to improve the scalability of computing logic-based
explanations, the ANNs can be simplified, before or during building their
encodings, via pruning or slicing as proposed by [12]. This results in equivalent
ANNs with smaller sizes.
