Your cell phones must be silenced during class.  Laptops are permitted in class for note taking purposes only, and are not necessary during case presentations.  Emailing, instant messaging, texting, and internet surfing are strictly prohibited. Because these activities are distracting and disrespectful to your classmates and your professor, I reserve the right to approach you in class without notification and warning, and to see what else you have opened on your laptop.  If there is anything other than Blackboard, PowerPoint, or Word open along your toolbar, you will be asked to leave the room.
