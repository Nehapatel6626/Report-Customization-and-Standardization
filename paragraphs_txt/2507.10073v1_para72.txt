For AI Governance and Policy Further, our findings reveal risks in deploying AI
systems across cultural contexts without considering their limitations in representing diverse
moral frameworks. As AI increasingly mediates social processes, inability to accurately
represent diverse moral intuitions could harm non-dominant cultural groups. Cultural impact
assessments should be part of AI governance frameworks, with additional safeguards where
significant limitations exist. Meaningful diversity in AI development teams is not merely a
matter of fairness but a technical necessity for creating systems that adequately represent
diverse human values.
