ROSAâ€™s architecture adheres to the MAPE-K loop (Kephart and Chess, 2003). It monitors the managed
subsystem, analyzes whether adaptation is required, when needed, plans how the managed subsystem
should be reconfigured, and executes the selected reconfigurations. All these steps interact with a central
KB.
