As a future work, we intend to integrate learning in ROSA. For example, machine learning methods
could be explored to update at runtime the Quality Attribute and Environmental Attribute
estimations and constraints values. Another possibility is learning that constraints and estimations exist
without prior knowledge, i.e., learning that the relationship itself should be modeled. ROSAâ€™s interfaces to
manipulate the KB at runtime could be exploited for this end.
