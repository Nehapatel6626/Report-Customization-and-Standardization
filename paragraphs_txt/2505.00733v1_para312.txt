The configuration planner component selects the configurations (i.e., function designs or
component configuration) with the highest priority. When the configuration planner receives an
event message indicating that monitoring data was written in the KB or that there was an update in the
required actions, it calls the services ‘/function/adaptable’ and ‘/component/adaptable’ to check which
Functions and Components must be adapted. Then, it calls the services ‘/function/selectable’ and
‘/component/selectable’ to check which function designs and component configurations are
available for the Functions and Components that need to be adapted. Finally, the configuration planner
selects the function designs and component configurations with the highest priority and
informs the KB about the newly selected configuration by calling the service ‘/select configuration’. When
this service is called, the KB component checks the current state of the robot, creates a reconfiguration
plan to bring the robot to the goal configuration, and sends an event message in the ‘/events’ topic to
inform that there is a new reconfiguration plan available.
