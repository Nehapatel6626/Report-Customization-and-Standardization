Figure 8-3: Active Defender Accuracy over Adaptation. In this Ô¨Ågure, we observe the
f1 score vs. the experimental stage over time. We plot the mean f1 score as points
and show the standard deviation in the surrounding band. In this experiment, we
observe the experiment achieving poor results in Stage 1 when evasive samples are
introduced. Over time, we observe that the f1 score increase over time as the system
adapts to evasive samples.
