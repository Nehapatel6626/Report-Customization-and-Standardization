Figure 5-1: Active Defender Classiﬁers: In active primary classiﬁers (C1,C2,C3) re-
ceive samples and produce probabilistic scores (p1,p2,p3). Secondary classiﬁers oper-
ate oﬀ of probabilistic scores as inputs. Secondary classiﬁer C4 uses inputs (p1,p2) to
produce the probabilistic score p4. Secondary classiﬁer C4 uses inputs (p1,p2,p3) to
produce the probabilistic score p5.
