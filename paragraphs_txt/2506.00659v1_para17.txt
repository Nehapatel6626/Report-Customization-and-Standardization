This paper presents PackHero, a packer identifier that leverages statically
extracted Call Graphs from packed programs. PackHero extracts the CG of a
given binary and identifies the packer by comparing it with previously labeled
graphs in a stored collection. The graph representation is inspired by the work of
X. Li et al. [17]. CGs enable a high level of abstraction and reveal that portions
of these graphs remain identical or similar for binaries packed with the same
packer. To leverage this, we introduce a heuristic to isolate the graph segment
corresponding to the unpacking stub, identifying unique patterns shared by bi-
naries processed by the same packer. To solve the graph similarity problem, we
use a specific Graph Neural Network (GNN) [11], known as a Graph Matching
Network (GMN) [18]. Additionally, PackHero incorporates a hierarchical clus-
tering approach to group similar graphs, enhancing identification accuracy while
ensuring constant inference time when integrating new packers.
