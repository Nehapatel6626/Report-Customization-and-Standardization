I will assign points based on completion of homework assignments and involvement during class activities/discussion. You will be asked to complete numerous homework assignments during the semester and turn them in during class. Your completion of these assignments will, in large part, determine this component of your grade. However, your grade will also consist of quizzes during class that assess your  knowledge of class discussion material and assignments.
