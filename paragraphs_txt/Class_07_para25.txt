Research methodology: most journals are concerned about this, as would be expected for an academic publisher. Is the research design, methodology, theoretical approach, critical review, etc. sound? Are the results well presented, do they correlate to the theory, and have they been correctly interpreted? Is the analysis sufficiently rigorous?
