The feasibility of using ROSA for runtime self-adaptation in robotic systems is demonstrated by applying
it to the SUAVE exemplar (Silva et al., 2023), and its adaptation performance is evaluated in comparison to
other approaches available in the exemplar. ROSA’s reusability is demonstrated by using it to model the
TACA scenarios described by Braberman et al. (2017) and C´amara et al. (2020). The development effort for
using ROSA is evaluated by analyzing the number of elements contained in the knowledge models created
to solve the aforementioned use cases and comparing it with the size of a BT-based approach used to solve
SUAVE. ROSA’s development effort scalability is demonstrated by showing how ROSA’s knowledge
model grows with the addition of extra adaptations in a hypothetical scenario.
