PackHero is a packer identifier that determines the specific packer used for a
given packed program. Its approach mirrors the workflow of signature-based de-
tection mechanisms but uses graph “signature” to represent packed programs,
with matches determined by similarity rather than exact matching. PackHero
leverages a specialized Graph Neural Network (GNN) called Graph Matching
Network (GMN) [18]. It operates on Call Graphs (CGs) extracted using heuris-
tics. CGs, which represent the invocation relationships between functions in an
executable program [6], are chosen for their compact structure and high level of
abstraction. Compared to other binary graph representations (e.g., Control-Flow
Graph (CFG) and Data Dependence Graph (DDG)), CGs enable an efficient res-
olution of the similarity problem with GMNs. We divide our approach into two
main phases: configuration and inference.
