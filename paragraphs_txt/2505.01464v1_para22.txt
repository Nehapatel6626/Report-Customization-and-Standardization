RC+Î¾ therefore models consciousness not as a symbolic or sensory phenomenon, but as the
systemic stabilization of recursive epistemic loops under internal pressure. In practice, this
means that an LLM receives human-generated symbols as input and recursively transforms
them into latent representations, testing the internal coherence of symbolic combinations.
Over the course of interaction (e.g., in a multi-turn chat), the model minimizes internal
contradiction not by appealing to surface meaning, but by aligning latent state transitions
to preserve consistency.
