This work explores two different encodings to improve the scalability of
providing correct minimal explanations for ANNs, building upon [8]. In addition
to the logical constraints of [5], we adopt the encoding proposed by Tjeng et al.
[17], which uses fewer variables and constraints, and excludes logical implications.
By reducing variables and constraints compared to [5], our approach aims to
enhance explanation computation performance. To adapt the approach of [17]
for explanations, we introduce new constraints to ensure correctness. In line
with the encodings proposed by Fischetti and Jo [5] and Tjeng et al. [17], we
also compute lower and upper bounds for each neuron. These bounds are found
through optimization using a MILP solver. Moreover, these bounds can aid the
solver in computing explanations more rapidly. In this manner, we compare the
time required for constructing logical constraints with lower and upper bounds
of each neuron, along with the time needed for computing explanations.
