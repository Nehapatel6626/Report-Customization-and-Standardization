ing, while unsupervised learning methods include generative
adversarial networks (GANs). GAN-based image captioning
systems are capable of producing a variety of image descrip-
tions. However, text processing relies on discrete numbers,
making the processes non-differentiable and challenging to ap-
ply back-propagation directly. The architecture of the method
presented by [44] is shown in Fig.3. It uses a GAN-based model
to generate artificial images from text, employing attention to
focus on relevant word vectors to create various parts of the im-
age. Subsequently, captions are produced for the image using
an attention-based image captioning model. [45] introduced a
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) based on the generative adversar-
ial structure network (GASN), which consists of three parts: a
consensus reasoning module, a sentence decoder with two lay-
ers of LSTM, and a grounding module to locate regions. This
method provided accurate and detailed information on objects
to predict words.
