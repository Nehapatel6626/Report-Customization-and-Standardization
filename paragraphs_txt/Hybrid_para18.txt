This paper concentrates on decision trees [4-9] and the na√Øve Bayes approach [11-17].  Decision trees are an extremely easy-to-understand method of classifying training data, and using the classification to predict.  [4,9] contain approaches to choosing attributes to split upon in decision trees.  [4] presents a family of measures called C-SEP (Class Separation).  The method utilizes the cosine of the angle between vectors associated with the nodes in the tree.  [9] discusses an approach that splits on an attribute with maximum information gain.
