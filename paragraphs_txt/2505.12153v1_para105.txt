where N represents the number of test cases, such as surgeries
performed in either a simulated or real environment, while T
denotes the total number of decision steps within each surgery.
The action taken by the RL policy at time step t for a given
case i is represented as ai
t corresponds to the
expert-defined correct action for the same state. The indicator
function I(Â·) evaluates whether the action taken matches the
expert benchmark, returning 1 if they align and 0 otherwise.
A higher task performance metric, denoted as Atask, suggests
that
the FL-trained policy is making decisions that more
closely align with expert strategies, thereby indicating greater
reliability for deployment in surgical tasks.
