Additionally, all ML-based approaches require complete retraining to inte-
grate new packers, a scalability issue PackHero avoids. To demonstrate this, we
simulate packer integration during the tool lifecycle. Assuming integration cost
depends on the number of samples used, we define the cost function f (n, m, l),
where n is the number of known packers, m the new packers, and l the samples
per packer. For other tools, f (n, m, l) = (n + m) · l, while PackHero ’s cost is
f (n, m, l) = m · l, as it only depends on new packers. Fig. 6 simulates m = 10
and l = 40, showing PackHero ’s constant integration cost, unlike other tools,
where cost grows linearly with the number of recognized packers. This result
demonstrates that PackHero scales effectively in realistic scenarios where new
packers must be integrated over time.
