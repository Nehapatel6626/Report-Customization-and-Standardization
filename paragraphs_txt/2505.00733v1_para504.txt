ROSA modular architecture has been designed to provide reuse and extensibility of the framework by
future works applying self-adaptation principles in robotics architectures. For example, the current ROSA
implementation supports integration with robotics architectures using planning or behavior tree solutions
for the task deliberation layer, but it would be interesting to extend it to support other decision-making
methods, such as state machines or Markov decision processes.
