The Challenge of Embodied Cognition Our findings provide empirical support for the
theoretical critique raised in the background section regarding the embodiment deficit in
LLMs. The difficulty these models demonstrate in representing culturally-specific moral
intuitions may reflect their fundamental disconnection from the embodied experiences that
shape human moral reasoning. Moral intuitions are not merely abstract principles but are
deeply connected to lived experiences, emotional responses, and cultural practices. Without
embodiment in the physical world, LLMs may be inherently limited in their ability to
represent the full richness of human moral cognition. This limitation suggests the need for
greater epistemological humility in deploying LLMs across cultural contexts. While these
models can generate text that superficially resembles human moral reasoning, our findings
indicate that they do not reliably capture the nuanced ways moral intuitions vary across
cultures. This disconnect between surface-level competence and deeper understanding
represents a fundamental challenge for AI alignment.
