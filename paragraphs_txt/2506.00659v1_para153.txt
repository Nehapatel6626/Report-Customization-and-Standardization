Different versions and configurations. The lab-10 dataset includes only
one configuration and version per packer. To evaluate transferability, we test
PackHero’s best configuration (lab-10 ) on the RGD dataset [16], which contains
multiple versions and configurations for each packer—except for tElock, which is
not included in the PackGenome evaluation. Table 4 presents the configurations
identified by PackHero for each version in RGD. An “identified configuration”
occurs when PackHero recognizes all samples, while non-identified configurations
show a 0% identification rate, likely due to differences in the unpacking stub.
Overall, PackHero generalizes across 16 out of 19 different versions, despite being
configured with only a single version and configuration per packer.
