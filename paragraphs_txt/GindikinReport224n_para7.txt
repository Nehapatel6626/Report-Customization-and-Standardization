Concepts of statistical natural language processing can be used in creating a system that will automatically generate mnemonic devices.  This seems like a natural application for a subject that relies on analyzing the properties of language, especially since some mnemonics are used for the express purpose of expanding oneâ€™s vocabulary.  The system as implemented creates mnemonics for two distinct types of information: 1. Numerical data and 2. Lexical data.  Each mnemonic is represented as an utterance that is generated to present data in a way that might help the user in recall.
