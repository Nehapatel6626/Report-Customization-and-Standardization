ing a clustering approach to enhance performance and reduce the search space,
PackHero evaluates the similarity between the extracted CG and labeled CGs
stored in a DB, employing a Graph Matching Network (GMN) to compute these
similarities and identify the packer. Evaluated on a public dataset of packed be-
nign and malicious programs re-packed multiple times, PackHero meets all key
requirements for a novel packer identifier: high accuracy, efficient packer integra-
tion, evasive behavior management, and scalability. Relying exclusively on static
analysis, PackHero integrates new packers effectively, achieving strong perfor-
mance with as few as 10 samples, while eliminating the limitations of dynamic
analysis, particularly against dynamic evasive behaviors. For some packers, it
avoids fine-tuning the GMN, and when fine-tuning is needed, it converges faster
than other ML-based tools. Its integration cost remains constant throughout
its lifecycle, unlike other methods, where costs grow linearly with the number of
packers recognized. PackHero performs comparably to signature-based tools, the
current best-performing solutions for packer identification, and significantly out-
performs SotA approaches on Themida, a VM-based packer employing advanced
dynamic evasive behaviors.
