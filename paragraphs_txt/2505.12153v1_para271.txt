Fig. 6 shows the interplay between data heterogeneity,
privacy-preserving noise, and model accuracy in a FL setting.
The 3D surface trend reveals a clear inverse correlation:
model accuracy declines as either data heterogeneity or noise
standard deviation increases. This aligns with existing FL
literature, where data divergence across clients impairs global
model convergence and generalization. Simultaneously, higher
noise levels while improving privacy further reduce accuracy,
reflecting the classic privacy-utility trade-off.
