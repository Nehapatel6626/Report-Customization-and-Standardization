Phrase structure organizes words into nested constituents.
How do we know what is a constituent?  (Not that linguists don't argue about some cases.)
Distribution: a constituent behaves as a unit that can appear in different places:
John talked [to the children] [about drugs].
John talked [about drugs] [to the children].
*John talked drugs to the children about
Substitution/expansion/pro-forms:
I sat [on the box/right on top of the box/there].
