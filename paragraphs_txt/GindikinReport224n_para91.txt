We had less success than we hoped with the qualitative results. While it was certainly amusing to see the system generating utterances like ‘Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for thy’ when trained on the bible corpus, we discovered that in fully automatic mode, the system would rarely come up with good mnemonics. On the other hand, we found that the computer can help in the mnemonics generating process, helping with the parts of the task that humans find hard, by using the stochastic language model to suggest likely words of length 9 or those that start with the required letter. We believe that, with some improvements, our vocabulary words system can be useful in assisting people in coming up with their own mnemonics. Our background research suggests that when people spontaneously generate their own devices, the recall is improved because people tend to come up with utterances, or other forms of encoding, that are personally salient to them. While we do not suggest that people should generate mnemonics for all the words they are attempting to memorize, we believe that it is useful to do so for those few that, due to the quirks of human memory, people repeatedly have trouble remembering.
