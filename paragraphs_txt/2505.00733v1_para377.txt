Critical battery level (U3), occurring only in the extended SUAVE use case, was solved with TACA by
extending the knowledge model with a recharge action, and a battery level constraint to the search
pipeline and inspect pipeline actions, representing the minimum battery level at which they can be selected.
Runtime behavior: when the battery level drops below 0.25, the status of both the search pipeline and
inspect pipeline actions is set to unfeasible, and the task decision layer cannot select them anymore.
Therefore, the task decision layer selects the recharge action which also triggers structural adaptation.
