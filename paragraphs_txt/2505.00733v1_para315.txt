When the execute component receives an event message indicating that a new reconfiguration plan was
added to the KB, it calls the service ‘/reconfiguration plan/get latest’ to get the latest reconfiguration
plan. Then, it adapts the robot’s architecture according to the reconfiguration plan. Finally, it calls the
services ‘/reconfiguration plan/result/set’ and ‘/component/active/set’ to update the KB with the result of
the reconfiguration plan and which components are active.
