Niemczyk and Geihs (2015); Niemczyk et al. (2017) propose ICE as a method for adapting the
information processing subsystem in multi-robot systems, specifically by adapting the connections between
system components. Their approach uses an ontology to define each componentâ€™s required inputs and
outputs, along with quality-of-service information for each connection. This ontology is then translated
into answer set programming (ASP), and an ASP solver determines an optimal configuration. While they
conceptually demonstrate how their method could be applied to robots, they do not demonstrate it with a
robotic system. Moreover, their approach focuses solely on structural and connection adaptation to maintain
the functionality of the information processing subsystem, without considering other subsystems of the
robotic system.
