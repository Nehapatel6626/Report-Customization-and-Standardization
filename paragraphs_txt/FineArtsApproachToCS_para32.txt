“[We are] strictly forbidden from working with other students on projects.  The cheating policy that [the professor] distributed first day of class said that, pretty much, ‘If we catch any duplication of code, anything that even resembles somebody else's code closely, you will both receive an immediate F in the class and be dropped’.  So, yeah we're not allowed to work with the other students at all.”
