Motivated by these challenges, we propose an active defender system to adapt to
evasive PDF malware in a resource-constrained environment. We observe this system
to improve the f1 score from 0.17535 to 0.4562 over ﬁve stages of receiving PDF ﬁles
that the system considers unlabeled. Furthermore, average classiﬁcation time per ﬁle
is low across all 5 stages, and is reduced from an average of 1.16908 seconds per ﬁle
to 1.09649 seconds per ﬁle.
