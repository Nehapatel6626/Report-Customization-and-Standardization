Figure 4-2: KDE approximation of Probability Density for percent of Virus Total-
Engines classiﬁers that classify a ﬁle as malicious. This plot shows the classiﬁcation
scores for diﬀerent types of ﬁles. The Benign ﬁles are shown as pink, the Contagio
malware samples are shown in purple, the EvadeML variants are shown in blue and
the Max-Diﬀ variants are shown in green. The KDE plot was generated with Gaus-
sian kernel of width 0.15, and 0.15 , 0.17,.17, for the Benign, Contagio, EvadeML,
and Max-Diﬀ ﬁles respectively.
