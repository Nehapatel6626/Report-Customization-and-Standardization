Very constrained grammars attempt to limit unlikely/weird parses for sentences
But the attempt make the grammars not robust: many sentences have no parse
A less constrained grammar can parse more sentences
But simple sentences end up with ever more parses
Solution: We need mechanisms that allow us to find the most likely parse(s)
Statistical parsing lets us work with very loose grammars that admit millions of parses for sentences but to still quickly find the best parse(s)
