We used the PDFs  of particles  to generate  209  digital urine  samples.  Each  digital urine
solution consisted  of RBCs, WBCs,  microbeads  and 'other'  particles.  To  determine  a  particle
count/HPF  for a digital urine  solution,  we sampled the  PDF. For the RBC  and WBC  counts  we
used the  RBC and  WBC  PDFs.  For the  microbeads,  we used  the PDF of the epithelial cells.  For
the 'other'  particles,  we  also used the PDF of the epithelial  cells,  but we  increased  the resulting
count drawn from the PDF  by  1.  So,  if we drew a count of 3.1  'other'  particles  per HPF from the
PDF,  we used  4.1  'other'  particles  per HPF  for the sample  of digital  urine.  The main  reason  for
this is to ensure that no digital  urine solution  has zero particles  in it, which  would bias our  results
because  the algorithm  would  always achieve  100%  accuracy on these  solutions  (with no  particles
to classify,  there  can be  no classification  errors).
