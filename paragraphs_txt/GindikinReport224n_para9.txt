The use of mnemonic devices dates back to the fifth century, BCE.  It is recorded that Simonides of Ceos used a technique that associated specific items with locations that were well-known to the person recalling the information [1].  The effectiveness of this method of memory recall has been confirmed through a number of studies where subjects link new information to different locations [2,3].  Similar improvements in recall have been shown to materialize by using music as a mnemonic device [4].
