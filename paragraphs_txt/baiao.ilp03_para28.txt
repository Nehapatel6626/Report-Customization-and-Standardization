The distribution designer provides input information about the database schema (its semantics – classes and relationships – and additional quantitative information such as the estimated cardinality of each class) and applications (projection, selection and navigation operations) that will be executed over the database. This information is then passed to the DDODB heuristic module. The DDODB heuristic module defines a set of heuristics to design an adequate fragmentation schema for a given database application. The execution of the heuristic module algorithms (analysis algorithm, vertical fragmentation and horizontal fragmentation) will follow this set of heuristics and quickly output an adequate fragmentation schema to the distribution designer. Previous results using the heuristic module are presented in [2, 3].
