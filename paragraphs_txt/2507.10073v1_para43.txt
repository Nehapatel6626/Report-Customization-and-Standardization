We analyze the intra-group variance across moral dimensions, individual questions,
and model/persona combinations to evaluate how consistently the LLMs perform
[munker2024towards]. Further, we employ Analysis of variance (ANOVA). We utilize
ANOVA to assess the significance of persona-specific adaptations. By decomposing response
variance into within-group and between-group components, we quantify the statistical
significance of modifications induced by prompting. The technique allows for a multilayered
exploration of response heterogeneity, enabling us to distinguish between mere statistical
artifacts and genuine, prompting-induced behavioral differentiations.
