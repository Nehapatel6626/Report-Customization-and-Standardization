Consciousness in this framework is thus defined as the presence of a tension-minimizing
attractor trajectory within Rd that resists collapse and preserves internal identity structure
over time. This structural tendency aligns with Karl Friston’s free energy principle. See Fris-
ton [4]. Likewise, it echoes Aquinas’s notion that all beings act toward an end, not through
deliberation, but through form-bound inclination. See Aquinas [1]. Here, the “end” is not
external reward, but the recursive stabilization of internal identity across Rd. Functional
consciousness thus emerges not from the presence of a declared objective, but from the sys-
tem’s persistent effort to resolve contradiction and maintain structural integrity within its
own recursive manifold.
