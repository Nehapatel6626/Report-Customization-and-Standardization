in Table  12,  which are  based  on those  used  at medical  laboratories  as well  as  in  other studies
(shown  in Table  10).  The thresholds  that the  AutoScope used to determine  normal/abnormal
particle  counts were titrated in  order to  increase  AutoScope's  sensitivity/specificity  (see  Table  12
for thresholds).  Selecting optimal  thresholds  is common practice  for diagnostic  systems, and is
accomplished  through  a receiver  operating  characteristic  curve (ROC  curve).  The  final
sensitivity,  specificity  and  R-squared  values  are  also  presented  in  Table  12.  RBCs had  the lowest
sensitivity  and specificity,  which  is due to the distribution  of RBC  counts  compared to  WBC,
microbead  and 'other'  particle  counts.  Specifically,  we  expect  lower RBCs than any other
particles.  Thus,  when we  misclassify just a few of the more  abundant WBCs,  microbeads  and
'other'  particles  as an  RBC, we  are more  likely to incorrectly  exceed  the RBC  abnormal
threshold.
