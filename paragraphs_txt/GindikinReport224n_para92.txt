In developing this system, we have come to the realization that generating really good mnemonics is an AI-complete problem. Mnemonics leverage the very human quality of making connections and associations between things, and it is precisely this common sense knowledge and understanding of what in the world is so connected and associated that computers lack. Still, using statistical techniques, the computers can begin to mimic such knowledge, and become useful in offloading parts of the task from people.
