In the example of figure 7, the positive instance is given by the term chooseVerticalFragmentationMethod(o1, atomicPart).  There are no negative instances defined. The objects are the sets of classes, relationships and operations of the application, while the facts define existing relations between application objects (e.g.: which classes are accessed by each relationship, which operations compose a query, which classes are accessed by each operation). TREND3 examples are passed to FORTE in a data file (DAT). The DAT file contains examples from which FORTE will learn, and also defines execution parameters to guide the FORTE learning process. The complete description of the DAT file for the OO7 benchmark is in [1].
