The SRB-300 speech corpus is divided into three datasets: training (76%), val-
idation (10%), and test (14%), as shown in Table 3. The test set also includes
6 hours of audio from 6 radio stations not present in the training or validation
datasets. This allows us to evaluate performance on previously unseen broadcast
stations.
