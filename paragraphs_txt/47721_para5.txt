Descriptive research includes surveys and fact-finding
 enquiries. The main characteristic of this method is that 
the researcher has no control over the variables; he can 
only report what has happened or what is happening
In analytical research, on the other hand, the researcher has to 
use facts or information already available, and analyze these to make
 a critical evaluation of the material.
Applied research aims at finding a solution for an 
immediate problem facing a society or an industrial/business 
organisation
“Gathering knowledge for knowledge’s sake is termed ‘pure’ or 
‘basic’ research.”
