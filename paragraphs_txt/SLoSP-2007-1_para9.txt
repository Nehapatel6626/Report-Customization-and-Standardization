The parsers produced detailed, linguistically rich representations
Parsers had uneven and usually rather poor coverage
E.g., 30% of sentences received no analysis
Even quite simple sentences had many possible analyses
Parsers either had no method to choose between them or a very ad hoc treatment of parse preferences
Parsers could not be learned from data
Parser performance usually wasn’t or couldn’t be assessed quantitatively and the performance of different parsers was often incommensurable
