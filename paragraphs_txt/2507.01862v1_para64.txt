Inference (With): 
Because <isCustomerConfirmed> evaluates to no on immediate follow up (“Dental”), the system realizes the user 
might be switching from “Delta Airlines” to “Delta Dental.” It asks a clarifying question to confirm intent before 
pivoting the context. This ensures fewer misinterpretations and a smoother conversation flow.
