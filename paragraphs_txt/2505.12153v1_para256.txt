Fig. 3. Performance Comparison of Federated versus Centralised RL. (a)
PLR over 50 global rounds, where lower PLR for FDRL indicates better
privacy preservation compared to the Centralised approach. (b) Average
Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence between local and aggregated (global)
policy distributions in FDRL, demonstrating the extent of divergence among
local models during training. (c) OPE over global rounds, computed as a
weighted combination of (1 – PLR), KL divergence, and an effective DP
decay term, highlighting the superior privacy–performance trade-off achieved
by Federated RL relative to Centralised RL
