The primary contributions of this paper are twofold. First, it introduces a new
realistic speech corpus for Swiss German STT. Unlike many existing datasets
for Swiss German, this new corpus includes long samples of spontaneous speech
recorded in real-world scenarios, such as conversations with various background
noises.
