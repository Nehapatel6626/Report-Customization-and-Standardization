The adaptation heuristic knowledge enables adaptation due to changes in the environment or the
system’s QAs with the constraint relationship by capturing constraints on the selection of Actions,
Components, function designs, or component configurations in terms of measured values of
Measures. It enables adaptation due to component failures by capturing a Component’s status as an
attribute and adaptation due to changes in the robot’s task execution by capturing what Actions need
to be performed with the required action relationship. At runtime, adaptation is triggered when a
measurement violates a constraint, when a component has a failure status, or when required actions change.
