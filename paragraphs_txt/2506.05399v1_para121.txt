Several studies have explored the use of deep machine learn-
ing in image captioning, with a focus on transformer-based at-
tention algorithms. However, there is a lack of thorough in-
vestigation into using transformer-based methodologies in im-
age captioning. This gap in existing image captioning surveys
has inspired this work to provide a comprehensive review of
transformer-based approaches in image captioning, particularly
focusing on attention-based methods. The attention mechanism
for generating image captions is an area of increasing research
interest due to its consistent relevance. Initial attempts to ad-
dress this issue using transformer-based approaches have shown
exceptional performance. Therefore, employing transformers
to improve image captioning holds great promise [26].
