The transformers incorporate positional encoding to intro-
duce the relative or absolute positions of the tokens into the
model. This helps maintain the parallel execution format of the
token sequence. The positional encoding values are calculated
using sine and cosine functions to represent the position and
training parameters. These positional encodings are combined
with language features to create embeddings that are aware of
the position within the sequence.
