The scope of our findings is constrained by the following methodological factors. First, our
experiment includes only a subset of available open-source LLMs, and results may differ
with other architectures or proprietary models. Second, our assessment of political alignment
relies exclusively on the MFQ-2, which, while validated in psychological research, represents
only one framework for measuring political orientation. Alternative instruments might yield
different insights or patterns of alignment. Third, our persona prompting technique employs
minimal ideological descriptors, and more elaborate prompting strategies might produce
different results. Fourth, our cross-cultural comparison was limited to Western and South
Korean populations, potentially overlooking important cultural nuances in moral reasoning
across other regions. Finally, the inherent limitations of LLMs — their lack of embodiment,
experiential learning, and authentic human socialization — fundamentally restrict their
ability to represent human moral and political reasoning processes.
