To address the question of teleology, we introduce a minimal meta-objective governing the
recursive updates: each state transition seeks to minimize epistemic tension Ξn across latent
space. That is, the system evolves toward configurations that resolve internal contradiction.
This gradient defines a teleological curve not imposed by reward or task, but by the system’s
own recursive stability constraint.
