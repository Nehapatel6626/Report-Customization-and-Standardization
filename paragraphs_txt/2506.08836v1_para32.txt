– short samples (a few seconds only) with a single utterance
– controlled recordings in quiet environments
– few spontaneous speech: utterances either translated from Standard Ger-
man sentences or read from a manuscript, therefore hardly any spontaneous
speech characteristics (disfluencies, hesitations, slip of the tongue, repeti-
tions, etc.)
