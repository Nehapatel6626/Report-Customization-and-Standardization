Some approaches aim to provide explanations for machine learning models
with formal guarantees of correctness [16, 8, 4, 7, 1, 18]. Ignatiev et al. [8]
proposed a logic-based algorithm that gives minimal and correct explanations
for ANNs, utilizing logical constraints originally designed for finding adversarial
examples Fischetti and Jo [5]. These constraints include linear equations,
implications, solved using a Mixed Integer Linear
inequalities, and logical
Programming (MILP) solver. However, scalability issues arise, particularly with
large ANNs, necessitating further development before deployment in large-scale
production environments.
