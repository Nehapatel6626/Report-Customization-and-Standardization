This research introduces Multi-Agent Collaborative Intelli-
gence (MACI), a framework designed to overcome funda-
mental limitations in current LLMs for reasoning and plan-
ning. By reimagining computational intelligence through
a hierarchical, distributed architecture, MACI represents a
structured approach to complex problem-solving.
