vn} of the feature space is encoded as a conjunction in a formula C, and the
associated prediction by the ANN is encoded as a formula E. Then, it holds
that C ∧ F |= E. The minimal explanation Cm of C is calculated removing
feature by feature from C. For example, given a feature xi with value v in C,
if C \ {xi = v} ∧ F |= E, feature xi may be considered as irrelevant in the
explanation and is removed from C. Otherwise, if C \ {xi = v} ∧ F ̸|= E, then xi
is kept in C since the same class cannot be guaranteed. This C\{xi = v} notation
represents the removal of xi = v from formula C. This process is described in
Algorithm 1 and is performed for all features. Then, Cm is the result at the
end of this procedure. This means that for the values of the features in Cm,
the ANN makes the same classification, whatever the values of the remaining
features. Since to check entailments C ∧ F |= E is equivalent to test whether
C ∧ F ∧ ¬E is unsatisfiable and F , C and ¬E are enconded as linear constraints
and indicator constraints, such a entailment can be addressed by a MILP solver.
