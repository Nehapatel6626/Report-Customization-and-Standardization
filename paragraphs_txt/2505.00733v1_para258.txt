2004)) do not satisfy the representation requirements above apart from allowing attributes for entities (part
of Requirement 4). Although it is possible to transform the proposed knowledge model into one that can be
represented with graph-based or description logic-based approaches by reifying the model (OlivÂ´e, 2007),

between the CDM and the machine-readable model, making it harder to understand and reuse it. Thus, this
work does not consider applying reification.
