The intuition behind cross-validation is that it would look for the most generic decision learner that performs well.  In this manner, it is ensured that the learner does not learn unwanted patterns.  It is to be noted that this is not a fool-proof technique, since a particular learner may perform very well on a given test set, but the test set may not be representative of the entire domain.
