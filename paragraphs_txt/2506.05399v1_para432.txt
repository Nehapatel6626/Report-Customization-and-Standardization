The model proposed by [56] was trained and tested using
images from the MS COCO and Flickr8K datasets. The MS
COCO dataset contains over 330,000 images and 2.5 million
captions, covering 80 object categories. The CrowdFlower crowd-
sourcing service was used to generate Arabic captions, resulting
in 5,358 captions for 1,166 images from the training set, with
an average of 4.6 captions per image.
