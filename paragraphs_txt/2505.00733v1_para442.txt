When navigating, the robot performs adaptation by selecting which corridors it needs to go through
given its feasible configurations, and by selecting a suitable architecture configuration for each corridor
it goes through. For example, to go from point A to B, the AGV can go directly through a corridor with
obstacles C1 or through corridors C4 → C3 → C2 without obstacles. Ideally, the AGV should go through
C1 as it is the shortest path. Considering that the Kinect and AMCL combination is the only one with
enough accuracy to go through a corridor with obstacles, in the case that the Kinect fails, the robot needs to
perform TACA by adapting its task plan to go through C4 → C3 → C2 while simultaneously adapting its
architecture, e.g., to use the lidar as its sensing component.
