Research in image captioning has gained significant impor-
tance across various fields. With its broad applicability and
growing technological advancements, image captioning drives
innovation across numerous domains in multiple real-world ap-
plications, offering significant benefits to industry and society.
In the field of medical imaging, for instance, surgeons can
apply image captioning to monitor therapy progress preoper-
atively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively [10].
In educa-
tion, researchers are exploring e-learning systems that integrate
image captioning to enhance web-based learning experiences
[11][12]. For visually impaired individuals, transformer-based
photo captioning frameworks are being developed to translate
visual content into written and spoken descriptions, improving
accessibility and promoting self-reliance [13]. Similarly, spe-
cialized image captioning models in smart local tourism are ex-
pected to power AI-driven platforms, providing enriched expe-
riences for travelers and local businesses alike [14].
