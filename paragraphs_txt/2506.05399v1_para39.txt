The survey included papers published between 2018 and
2024. A keyword search was conducted on Google Scholar us-
ing the following terms: image captioning, image description,
image text generation, transformer-based image captioning, and
attention-based image captioning. Google Scholar was chosen
to avoid bias towards any specific publisher [30]. The survey
covers articles on image captioning in multiple languages, in-
cluding, but not limited to, English, Arabic, Vietnamese, Myan-
mar, and Indonesian.
