To address the limitations of SAS methods for TACA, this paper proposes to extend traditional robotics
architectures with a novel knowledge-based managing subsystem for RObot Self-Adaptation (ROSA)
that promotes reusability, composability, and extensibility. The main novelty of ROSA is its knowledge
base (KB) which captures knowledge about the actions the robot can perform, the robot’s architecture, the
relationship between both, and their requirements to answer questions such as “What actions can the robot
perform in situation X?” and “What is the best configuration available for each action in situation Y?”, for
example, “Can the robot perform an inspection action when the battery level is lower than 50%?” or “What
is the best software configuration for the inspection action when the visibility is low?”. This results in a
reusable solution for TACA in which all application-specific aspects of the adaptation logic are captured in
its KB.
