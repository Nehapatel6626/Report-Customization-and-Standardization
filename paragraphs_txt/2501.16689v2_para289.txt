Distributed Validation for Reliable Decision-Making:
MACI establishes a distributed validation mechanism that
enhances system reliability. By incorporating independent
veriÔ¨Åcation agents, the framework transcends the proba-
bilistic limitations of traditional language models, introduc-
ing a new paradigm of self-checking computational intelli-
gence.
