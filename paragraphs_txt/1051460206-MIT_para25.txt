system that could  accurately  detect  red blood cells  (RBCs),  white blood cells  (WBCs), and other
particles  in  urine.  The  Autoscope is a proof-of-concept  for this end-to-end  automated
microscopic  urinalysis  system.  A  similar  system can eventually  be  applied to  microscopic
analysis  of blood.
