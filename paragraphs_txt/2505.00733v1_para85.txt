Hochgeschwender et al. (2016) argue that robots should have access to and exploit software-related
knowledge about how they were engineered to support runtime adaptation. They demonstrate how labeled
property graphs (LPGs) can be used to persistently store and compose different domain models specified
with domain-specific languages (DSL) to enable runtime architectural adaptation. Although their approach
is interesting, its reusability is limited as it does not define a knowledge model that can be reused for other
