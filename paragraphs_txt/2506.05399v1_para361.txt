The LATGeO framework, based on transformer technology,
was introduced in [105] to generate captions for images. It in-
corporates multi-level geometrically coherent and visual rec-
ommendations to establish relationships between objects based
on their localized ratios. A new label-attention module (LAM)
was developed to connect the visual and linguistic aspects to
extend the traditional transformer. In this proposed approach,
object labels are included as input data at each decoder layer to
assist in constructing captions.
