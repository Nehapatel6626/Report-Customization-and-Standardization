Despite the transformative potential of RL in RAS, several
formidable challenges impede its widespread adoption and
clinical translation. A primary obstacle is the inherent het-
erogeneity of surgical environments. These environments are
characterized by significant inter-patient anatomical variability,
diverse patient comorbidities, and surgeon-specific procedural
preferences, all of which contribute to a high degree of com-
plexity and pose a substantial challenge to the generalizability
of RL models [8]â€“[10]. Furthermore,
the development of
robust RL models necessitates access to large, diverse datasets
of surgical procedures. However, individual healthcare institu-
tions often suffer from data scarcity, which limits the ability
of RL models trained in isolation to generalize effectively
to real-world clinical settings, particularly when encountering
rare pathologies or unanticipated procedural complexities [11].
Moreover, RL-based surgical systems rely heavily on sen-
sitive patient data, including intraoperative sensor readings,
medical imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT scans), and com-
prehensive electronic health records (EHRs). The use of such
sensitive information necessitates strict adherence to stringent
data privacy regulations and ethical guidelines, such as those
mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountabil-
ity Act (HIPAA) and the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) [12], [13].
