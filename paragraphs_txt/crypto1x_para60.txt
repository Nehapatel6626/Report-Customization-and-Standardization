Chosen-ciphertext attack (active-adaptive):       the adversary is additionally able to obtain some information  about the decryption of ciphertexts of its choice, other than the one it must decrypt (or obtain information about its plaintext).                
Different applications of encryption may require the encryption scheme to be resilient to different types of attack.
