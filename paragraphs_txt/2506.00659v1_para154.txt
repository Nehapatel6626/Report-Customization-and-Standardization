Answer to RQ1. The number of packed programs required to configure Pack-
Hero depends on the desired performance level. With just 10 samples per packer,
PackHero achieves a minimum macro-average F1 score of 93.7% and accuracy of
98.7%. Increasing the sample size to 30 can further improve recall and F1-score
while maintaining high precision and accuracy. Table 3 demonstrates PackHero’s
ability to effectively identify multiple packers from different families. Given the
dataset’s composition, PackHero successfully integrates and recognizes packers
of varying complexity in both packed malware and benign programs. Specifically,
based on the taxonomy by Ugarte-Pedrero et al. [34], PackHero performs well
on Type-I (UPX), VM-based (Themida), and Type-III (PECompact) packers.
