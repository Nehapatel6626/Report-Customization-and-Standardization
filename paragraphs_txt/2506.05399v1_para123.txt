The study by [29] explores prospective advancements in the
automatic generation of medical imaging reports using deep
learning. Inspired by image captioning techniques, deep learn-
ing algorithms have significantly improved the efficiency and
accuracy of diagnostic report generation. The paper provides
a review of research efforts in this domain, focusing on deep
learning architectures such as hierarchical RNN-based frame-
works, attention-based models, and reinforcement learning-based
approaches. Additionally, it examines the applications, under-
lying architectures, datasets, and evaluation methods used in
medical imaging report generation. The study identifies key
challenges in the field and proposes future research directions
to enhance clinical applications and decision-making through
more advanced report-generation methods.
