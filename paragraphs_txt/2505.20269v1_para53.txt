In Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), the objective is to optimize a
linear function subject to linear constraints, where some or all of the variables
are required to be integers [2]. MILP is a crucial technique in our work for
determining the lower and upper bounds of each neuron in the ANNs. For
example, we utilize a minimization problem to determine the lower bound of
neurons within ANNs. This process involves formulating an objective function
that seeks to minimize the lower bound, subject to constraints that reflect the
behaviour of ANNs. To illustrate the structure of a MILP, we provide an example
