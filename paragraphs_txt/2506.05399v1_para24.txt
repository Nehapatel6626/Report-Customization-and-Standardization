Given the challenges of using template-based and retrieval-
based approaches, a third approach based on deep learning has
been introduced. This approach follows recent developments in
deep neural networks, widely used in computer vision and natu-
ral language processing. Deep neural networks can provide ef-
fective solutions for visual and language modeling [6]. As a re-
sult, they have been used to improve existing systems and create
many innovative approaches [1]. Before significant advances
in deep learning methods, image captioning was done mainly
using traditional machine learning-based techniques, which in-
cluded feature extraction methods like Scale-Invariant Feature
Transform (SIFT), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and Histogram
of Oriented Gradients (HOG) [8, 9]. A classifier was then used
to classify the items after feature extraction. However, tradi-
tional approaches are less preferred than deep learning-based
methods, which automatically learn features due to the com-
plexity of feature extraction from massive amounts of data [7].
Numerous recent publications have focused on applying deep
machine learning to caption images [2].
