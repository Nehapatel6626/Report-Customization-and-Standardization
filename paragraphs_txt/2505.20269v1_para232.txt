Figure 2 suggests that our proposal, for ANNs with one hidden layer,
achieved a superior average running time for computing explanations in
the voting dataset. This encoding outperforms the other approach with
percentage improvements ranging from approximately 7.69% to 40.82%. The
most significant improvements are observed with higher neuron counts. For
instance, with 85 neurons per layer, our proposal shows an improvement
of around 40.82%, and with 95 neurons, the improvement is about 31.65%.
Moreover, our proposal generally exhibits similar or lower standard deviations,
indicating more consistent performance across different number of neurons.
