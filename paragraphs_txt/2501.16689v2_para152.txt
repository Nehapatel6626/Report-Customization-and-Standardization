This structured retrieval mechanism ensures that MACI ef-
ﬁciently scales to complex planning problems without re-
quiring predeﬁned agent hierarchies. By leveraging pro-
tocol buffers and a structured repository, MACI achieves
both modularity and adaptability, allowing new agents to be
introduced seamlessly while maintaining coherence across
multi-agent interactions.
