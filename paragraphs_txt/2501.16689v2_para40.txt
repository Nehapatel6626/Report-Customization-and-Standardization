The development of MACI builds on theoretical insights
from formal systems and addresses limitations of current
multi-agent architectures. Gödel’s second incompleteness
theorem (Kennedy, 2008; Gödel, 1967) established that no
consistent formal system can prove its own consistency.
This principle extends to LLMs, which rely on probabilis-
tic rather than axiomatic foundations, making them inher-
ently incapable of reliable self-validation. To address this,
MACI employs a distributed validation architecture, where
independent agents validate externally the output, bypass-
ing the self-referential loops that may lead to inconsisten-
cies.
