To rigorously evaluate the performance and privacy char-
acteristics of our proposed FDRL framework, we conducted
a series of simulations designed to mimic real-world sur-
gical scenarios. This section details the experimental setup,
simulation parameters, and the hardware used, providing a
comprehensive overview of our experimental methodology.
