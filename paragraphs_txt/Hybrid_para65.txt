of an exponential curve, with the exception of a plateau.  We observed that as χ increases, the number of nodes pruned increases exponentially.  Hence, the amount of information loss, which is proportional to node loss, is also exponential in nature, resulting in a large number of errors.  The plateau in the graph is due to a region of χ values that have very few nodes between them.  This is a property of the dataset.
