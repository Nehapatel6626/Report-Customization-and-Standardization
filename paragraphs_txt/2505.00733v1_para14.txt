are better suited to the new configuration. To address this challenge, robots can be designed as self-adaptive
systems (SASs) with the ability to perform task-and-architecture co-adaptation (TACA) (CÂ´amara et al.,
2020), i.e., simultaneously adapt their task execution and software architecture dependently during runtime.
This work focuses on proposing a systematic solution for enabling TACA that can be reused with different
robotic systems.
