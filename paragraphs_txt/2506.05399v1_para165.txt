image. E stands for the embedding matrix of dimension m × k.
The dimension of the embedding vector is indicated by the let-
ter m, and the letter n indicates the dimension of the hidden
state LSTM. Furthermore, σ and ⊙ represent logistic sigmoid
and element-wise multiplication, respectively. A typical LSTM
unit is shown in Fig.2.
