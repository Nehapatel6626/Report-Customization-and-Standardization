a human-written reference sentence using generalized unigram
matching. The score is computed based on the matched words’
precision, recall, and alignment. When multiple reference sen-
tences are involved, the candidate’s final evaluation score is de-
termined by choosing the best score among all independently
computed ones. METEOR incorporates stemming, synonym
matching, and standard exact word matching, making it more
effective at the sentence or segment level [7]. The maximum
score can be estimated by computing the F-measure through
explicit unigram matching (i.e., word-for-word matching) be-
tween the candidate and reference translations. The METEOR
metric is defined as
