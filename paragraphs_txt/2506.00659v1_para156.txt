We evaluate the impact of the clustering approach on PackHero’s performance
and scalability. To do this, we replicate the experiment from Section 4.2 without
the clustering layer: PackHero evaluates similarity with all graphs in the DB
and computes packer-specific thresholds instead of cluster-specific ones. Fig. 4
illustrates the performance gap between PackHero with and without clustering.
This gap is more pronounced for smaller training set sizes and narrows as the
training set size increases. Without clustering, the unknown rate consistently
drops to 0, as the unknown classification (explained in Section 3) depends on
the similarity step involving clusters’ medoids. However, the absence of clustering
increases False Positives. These results demonstrate that incorporating clustering
