In this case, last node (current tail node) is removed from the list. This operation is a bit more tricky, than removing the first node, because algorithm should find a node, which is previous to the tail first.
It can be done in three steps: 
Update tail link to point to the node, before the tail. In order to find it, list should be traversed first, beginning from the head. 
Set next link of the new tail to NULL. 
Dispose removed node.
