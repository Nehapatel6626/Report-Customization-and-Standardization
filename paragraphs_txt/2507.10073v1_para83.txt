This research was conducted in accordance with the ACM Code of Ethics. The raw results,
implementation details, and code-base are available upon request from the corresponding
author (muenker@uni-trier.de). We acknowledge the ethical complexities of using AI to
simulate human political perspectives and have made efforts to interpret our findings with
appropriate caution, avoiding overstatement of LLMsâ€™ capabilities to represent human
belief systems. We emphasize that our work should not be used to justify the replacement
of diverse human participants in social science research with AI-generated responses, as
our findings specifically highlight the limitations of such approaches. Furthermore, we
recognize the potential for misuse of persona-based LLM applications in political contexts
and advocate for continued critical examination of these technologies as they evolve.
