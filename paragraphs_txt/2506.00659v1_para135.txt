Configuration. PackHero requires a configuration phase starting with the step
of collecting programs. If the packer is accessible, i.e., we can use it to craft
new samples, the configuration becomes trivial and we can obtain as many pro-
grams as we need. However, if the packer is not accessible, we need to collect
packed programs in the wild. These programs can be malware or benign, and
it is uncertain whether we can find them in large quantities. Therefore, we test
PackHero in a scenario with a limited number of programs, defining the num-
ber of programs needed for each packer to achieve a good average performance.
From the lab-10, we select 100 programs for each packer to configure PackHero,
maintaining the original distribution of malware and benign programs. We use
