focus on generating intelligent and flexible behavior by integrating cognitive capabilities such as planning,
perception, or reasoning. However, being integral solutions, these works provide a blueprint for the
complete robot control system and are not intended for reuse and integration with other methods, thus
making it difficult to adapt and customize for specific applications.
