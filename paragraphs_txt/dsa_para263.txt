In general case, new node is always inserted between two nodes, which are already in the list. Head and tail links are not updated in this case. 
We need to know two nodes "Previous" and "Next", between which we want to insert the new node.
This also can be done in two steps: 
Update link of the "previous" node, to point to the new node. 
Update link of the new node, to point to the "next" node.
