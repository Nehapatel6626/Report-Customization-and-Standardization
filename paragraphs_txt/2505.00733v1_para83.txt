Braberman et al. (2017) proposed MORPH as a reference architecture to enable TACA. They showcased
on a conceptual level how MORPH can be applied to enable TACA in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
use case. However, since MORPH is only demonstrated at a conceptual level, it is hard to evaluate the
feasibility of applying MORPH to robotic systems at runtime. To the best of our knowledge, there is no
framework implementing the complete MORPH architecture. Therefore, it is not possible to directly reuse
MORPH.
