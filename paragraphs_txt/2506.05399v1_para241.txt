Attention mechanisms are widely used in applications such
as image captioning, machine translation, speech recognition,
image synthesis, and visual question-answering models [5] [53].
Attention has been shown to connect the meaning of features,
which aids in understanding how one aspect relates to another.
Incorporating this into a neural network helps the model fo-
cus on the most important and relevant features while ignoring
other noisy parts of the data space distribution [35].
