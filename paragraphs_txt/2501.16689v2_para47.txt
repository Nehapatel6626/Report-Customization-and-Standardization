By integrating these advanced mechanisms, MACI goes be-
yond existing MAS frameworks to provide a cohesive ar-
chitecture for complex reasoning and planning. It ensures
a high degree of scalability and robustness, making it suit-
able for applications ranging from logistical optimization
to adaptive decision-making in uncertain environments.
