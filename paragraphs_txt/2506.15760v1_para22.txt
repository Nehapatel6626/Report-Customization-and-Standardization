Similar to compilers that convert high-level instructions to hardware-dependent machine 
language, transpilation is a process of converting a given quantum circuit to match the 
topology of a specific quantum chip and optimize the circuits for executions. Transpilers 
can run locally with Qiskits or remotely as a cloud service. The runtime service is critical 
for current resource-constraint quantum devices.
