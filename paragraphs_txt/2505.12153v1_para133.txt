Here, Ft denotes the force applied by the robotic tool at time
t, which must be controlled to avoid excessive pressure on
tissues. The term Td,t represents the degree of tissue damage
detected at time t, measured through real-time force sensors or
medical imaging. The binary indicator Ct takes a value of 1 if
a critical surgical error occurs and 0 otherwise. The parameters
w1, w2, w3 are weighting coefficients that adjust the relative
contribution of each risk factor to the overall score.
