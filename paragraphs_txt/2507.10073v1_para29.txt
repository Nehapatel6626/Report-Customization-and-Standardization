The usage of LLMs as human simulacra (representation) began with the application
as non-player characters (NPCs) in a Sims-style game world to simulate interpersonal
communication and day-to-day lives [park2023generative]. The application of LLMs as
synthetic characters has expanded beyond gaming environments into various fields of social
science research [argyle2023out]. These disciplines have increasingly adopted these models
as replacements in social studies, arguing that conditioning through prompting causes the
systems to accurately emulate response distributions from a variety of human subgroups
[argyle2023out]. This approach represents a paradigm shift in research methodology,
promising unprecedented scalability and diversity in social science investigations. However,
this methodological innovation comes with profound methodological and ethical challenges.
Current research raises critical concerns about several fundamental issues:
