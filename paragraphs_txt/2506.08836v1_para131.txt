In a separate experiment, we concatenated consecutive test set samples to
create complete audio broadcasts. The resulting test audio files reached lengths
of up to 1 hour, with an average duration of 21 minutes. Using the ZHAW
medium and ZHAW large-v3 models, we found that the performance is similar
to the results presented in Table 4. This indicates that the findings in Table 4
remain valid even for audio segments considerably longer than those typically
found in scientific datasets.
