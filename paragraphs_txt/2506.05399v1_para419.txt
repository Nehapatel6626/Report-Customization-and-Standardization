effectiveness of image captioning methods. For example, a
method might have a high BLEU score but a low CIDEr or
SPICE score, indicating different strengths and weaknesses. This
highlights the need for robust and adaptable methods for diverse
datasets and languages. Comparative analysis underscores the
importance of adapting image captioning methods to specific
contexts. Although some methods perform well on certain datasets,
they may not perform as well on others, emphasizing the impor-
tance of continued development and adaptation in image cap-
tioning.
