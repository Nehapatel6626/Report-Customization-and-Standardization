Final answer
An encryption scheme is secure if no adversary can determine any meaningful information about the plaintext from the ciphertext.
What is considered to be a break?
What is assumed to be the power of the adversary?
A first definition of security:
A cryptographic scheme for a given task is secure if no adversary of a specified power (e.g., an “efficient adversary”)  can achieve a specific break.
