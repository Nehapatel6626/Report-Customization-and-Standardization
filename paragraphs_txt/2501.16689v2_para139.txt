MACI avoids relying on a single LLM to execute complex,
multi-step reasoning sequentially. Instead, it utilizes small,
independent agents that adhere to strict efﬁciency and mod-
ularity principles. These agents operate with well-deﬁned
input/output protocols and are constrained to restricted con-
text windows to mitigate attention bias and prevent earlier
constraints from being overridden by recent context.
