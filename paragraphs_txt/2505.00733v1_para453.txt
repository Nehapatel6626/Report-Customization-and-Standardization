This evaluation demonstrates that in addition to SUAVE, the knowledge required for the adaptation logic
to solve the AGV and UAV use cases can be captured with ROSA’s knowledge model. This indicates that
ROSA’s knowledge model can be used to capture the knowledge required for TACA in adaptation scenarios
similar to the ones presented. Furthermore, it shows that all entities and relationships contained in the
proposed knowledge model had to be used to model the aforementioned adaptation scenarios, supporting
their inclusion in the knowledge model.
