The Flickr8K dataset, which consists of 8,000 images, ini-
tially includes five English captions per image. The first 2,261
images from its training set were selected for this study, and
a professional translator created 750 Arabic captions. The re-
maining images were translated into Arabic using Google Trans-
late, followed by manual verification by native speakers. In to-
tal, 3,427 images (from both MS COCO and Flickr8K) were
used, with a vocabulary size of 9,854 words, and the longest
caption containing 27 words. For experiments, the dataset was
split into 2,400 training images (70%), 411 development im-
ages (12%), and 616 test images (18%).
