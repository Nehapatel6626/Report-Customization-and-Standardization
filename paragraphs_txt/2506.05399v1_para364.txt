utilizes self-attention to enhance the performance of sequence-
analysis tasks. This has led to exploring transformers in [107].
The experimental validation was conducted using the caption
dataset from the University of California (UC)-Merced. The
proposed technique can potentially generate helpful textual de-
scriptions for remote-sensing images.
