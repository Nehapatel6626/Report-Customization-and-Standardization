exposing patient data. The integration of privacy-enhancing
techniques such as DP, SMPC, and HE ensures robust pro-
tection against privacy threats while maintaining high surgical
precision. The dynamic policy adaptation mechanism further
enhances adaptability by selecting optimal RL policies based
on patient-specific conditions and surgical complexities, im-
proving decision-making in robotic-assisted procedures.
