To address these pressing challenges data scarcity, pri-
vacy concerns, and procedural variability we propose a novel
Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FDRL) framework
designed to enhance both security and adaptability in RAS.
Motivated by these privacy imperatives and the need for
enhanced adaptability and robustness in surgical RL, this re-
search introduces a novel FDRL framework explicitly designed
for RAS. Our approach integrates advanced cryptographic
privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), including differential
privacy, Secure Aggregation, and Homomorphic Encryption
(HE), to provide robust guarantees of patient data confiden-
tiality throughout the federated training process [20]. A key
innovation of our framework is the dynamic policy adaptation
mechanism. This mechanism empowers surgical robots to
intelligently select and execute the most appropriate RL policy
in real-time, based on the dynamic and evolving context of
the surgical procedure, including patient-specific conditions,
surgical complexity, and procedural demands [21]. Through
this dynamic adaptation, the proposed framework significantly
enhances surgical adaptability, precision, and patient safety
by leveraging a diverse repertoire of federated-trained RL
policies.
