The ability of the system to generate good mnemonic devices relies on proper training that enables the system to recognize the proper structure of valid sentences.  The language model used for this system required only a basic count of the occurrences of bigrams in different text corpora.  These counts, produced a collection of probabilities that characterized the general properties of the corpora processed.  Obviously, using different corpora can produce training sets that are possibly very different from each other in terms of lexical content and word pair relationships.  Common word pairings found in the Bible might not appear with the same frequency as those found in a Jane Austen novel.  For example, a large portion of sentences in the Bible start with the word “And,” which is rare in any of the other text sources.  Such differences alter the character of the sentence generated by the system.
