source multi-agent system (MAS) frameworks, the infras-
tructure component supports essential operations such as
agent registration, message routing, resource allocation,
and deployment scaling. This foundation provides the nec-
essary runtime environment for executing and monitoring
the generated workï¬‚ows.
