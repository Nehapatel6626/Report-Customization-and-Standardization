This is a very important and pivotal section
 and everything else in the study is centered
 around it
The objective of the proposed study should
 be stated very clearly 
The objective stated should be  specific, achievable and measurable
Too many objectives to be avoided
Even just one clearly stated relevant objective for a study would be good enough 
If there is more than one objective the objectives can be presented in  the appropriate order of importance
