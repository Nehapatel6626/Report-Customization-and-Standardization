I will take attendance on 20 random days during the semester at the beginning or end of class (likely on presentation days). If you are not in your seat then, you will be marked absent. If you have other commitments that may prevent you from being on time, please discuss them with me. If you leave the class before the class ends, you will be marked absent. Because much of your learning (and my assessment of your learning) is based on class discussions and activities, it is imperative that you attend class and participate in class discussions and activities.
