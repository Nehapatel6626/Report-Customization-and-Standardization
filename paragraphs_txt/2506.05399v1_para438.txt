In a separate study, [4] developed the ArabicFlickr1K dataset
using an active learning-based framework to translate an exist-
ing dataset. The final ArabicFlickr1K dataset contains 1,095
images, with three to five Arabic captions per image. This
dataset was designed to support Arabic image captioning mod-
els, offering a diverse and linguistically rich dataset for im-
proved training and evaluation.
