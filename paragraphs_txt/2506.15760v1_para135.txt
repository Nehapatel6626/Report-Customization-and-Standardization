Quantum phase transforms are additions in frequency domain, The full recursion period- 
finding algorithm calls 196 time recursively to factor 35. For a number N = 91(7 
13), the 
algorithm calls itself 257 times. The experiments were carried out on ibmq qasm simulator 
using Ubuntu18.10 Cosmic64 
bit virtual machine installed with Qiskit. Initially all 13 
qubits are set to superposition states using the Hadamard gates. An additional two groups 
of  registers  one  that  contains  6  qubits  and  another  one  contains  9  qubits  are  used  to 
store temporary results. A group of 14 quantum registers to store the final results after 
measurements. Using the AQFT method, the recursive calls were reduced to 54 and 178 
respectively, a roughly n 
log2n improvement without affecting the final results. In both 
cases, the quantum instance fires 1024 shots at the backend.
