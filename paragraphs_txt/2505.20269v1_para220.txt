The results of the first experiment are shown in Table 1. For each dataset, its
number of features is indicated in parentheses. The column Exp (s) refers to the
average running time for computing explanations in seconds, and the standard
deviation is also presented. The column Build (s) refers to the average running
time, in seconds, for building the logical constraints of the trained ANN. The
running time for finding the bounds of variables is included in the time for
building the encodings.
