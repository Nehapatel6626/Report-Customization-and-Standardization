Knowledge model and rules: To exemplify how the knowledge model is implemented, Listing 1 depicts
how the functional-requirement relationship and the Action entity are defined with TypeQL
(TypeDB’s query language). Line 1 defines the functional-requirement relationship, and lines 2-3
define that it can relate elements that play the role of actions and required-functions. Lines 5-7 define
the Action entity and that it has the attributes ‘action-name’ (its unique identifier) and ‘action-status’.
Lines 8-9 define that it can play the action role in a functional-requirement relationship and the
constrained role in a constraint relationship.
