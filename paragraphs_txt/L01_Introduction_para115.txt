Inductive Learning: inferring new knowledge from observations (not guaranteed correct)
Concept/Classification Learning - identify characteristics of class members (e.g., what makes a CS class fun, what makes a customer buy, etc.)
Unsupervised Learning - examine data to infer new characteristics (e.g., break chemicals into similar groups, infer new mathematical rule, etc.)
Reinforcement Learning - learn appropriate moves to achieve delayed goal (e.g., win a game of Checkers, perform a robot task, etc.)
Deductive Learning: recombine existing knowledge to more effectively solve problems
