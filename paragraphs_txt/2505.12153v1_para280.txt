Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the FDRL
framework in achieving an optimal balance between privacy
and performance. The privacy-utility tradeoff analysis con-
the framework successfully Minimises the PLR
firms that
while preserving high surgical precision. Compared to central-
ized RL approaches, FDRL reduces the risk of data exposure,
maintains model performance across diverse surgical tasks,
and enhances policy generalization by leveraging institution-
specific procedural knowledge. Additionally, policy divergence
emerges as an implicit privacy-preserving measure, reducing
the risk of reconstructing sensitive patient data from the shared
global model.
