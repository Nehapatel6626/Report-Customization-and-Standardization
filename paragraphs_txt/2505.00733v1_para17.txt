In addition to a conceptual framework, this work provides a reference implementation of ROSA as
an open-source framework that can be reused for research on self-adaptive robotic systems. ROSA is
implemented as a ROS 2-based system Macenski et al. (2022), leveraging TypeDB (Dorn and Pribadi, 2023,
2024) for knowledge representation and reasoning, and behavior trees (BT) (Colledanchise and Â¨Ogren,
2018) as well as PDDL-based planners (Ghallab et al., 1998) for task decision-making.
