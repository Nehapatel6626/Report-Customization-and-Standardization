Figure 4-1: KDE approximation of Probability Density for the PDFRate scores. This
plot shows the classiﬁcation scores for diﬀerent types of ﬁles. The Benign ﬁles are
shown as pink, the Contagio malware samples are shown in purple, the EvadeML
variants are shown in blue and the Max-Diﬀ variants are shown in green. The KDE
plot was generated with Gaussian kernel of width 0.15, and 0.15 , 0.17,.17, for the
Benign, Contagio, EvadeML, and Max-Diﬀ ﬁles respectively. In this case the Evade-
ML, Max-Diﬀ, and Benign ﬁles had very similar probability densities. In order to
diﬀerentiate them, diﬀering width kernels were used.
