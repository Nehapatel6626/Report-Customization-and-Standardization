In this experiment, we compare the performance of PackHero with State-of-the-
art signature-based methods (Detect It Easy (DIE) and PackGenome). DIE [13]
is currently the best-performing and most signature-rich packer identifier. Here,
we use its latest available version (v3.10). PackGenome [16] is the best tool for au-
tomating the extraction of signatures for packer detection, generating YARA [3]
rules that can be later used to identify packers. The authors of PackGenome
have already compared their framework against DIE, but we include the re-
sults for both approaches for completeness. To compare the three frameworks,
we use the False Positive Rate (FPR) and recall. We focus on recall because
it is the most representative metric when comparing tools designed not just
for identification but also for detection (as for DIE and PackGenome). We ex-
tract all results from the lab-10 dataset, removing only the 100 samples for each
packer used to configure PackHero. We test DIE using its command-line version,
while we test PackGenome by loading the YARA rules provided in the orig-
inal work. Since DIE does not include PELock signatures and PackGenomeâ€™s
authors did not perform experiments on PELock and tElock, we discard these
two packers for this comparison. In Table 6, we show the comparison results.
Starting with the recall, the three tools perform very similarly, although the two
signature-based tools generally exhibit the highest recall. Attention must partic-
ularly be directed towards Themida, which poses significant challenges for both
DIE and PackGenome, as depicted in the table. An interesting observation is
that the matched signatures from DIE are related to the same version of Winli-
cense/Themida, specifically Themida with Trial/Licensing options [25]. Despite
PackGenome including signatures for the same version of this packer, it shows a
recall of 0.31. This result motivates the entire work. Indeed, Themida/Winlicense
employs advanced (dynamic) evasive behaviors in its packed programs. Further-
more, it is the VM-based packer used during our evaluation. As explained in
