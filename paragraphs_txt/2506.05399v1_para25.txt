Deep learning algorithms are effective at handling the com-
plexities of image captioning. This survey offers a comprehen-
sive analysis of transformer models and attention mechanisms
in image captioning, providing a current overview of the rele-
vant literature. The discussion is structured around the follow-
ing research questions.
