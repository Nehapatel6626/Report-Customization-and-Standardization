Image captioning combines research from the computer vi-
sion and natural language processing communities [1]. A cap-
tioning model aims to present a scene and text, a task that comes
naturally to the human brain. It is common for humans to in-
terpret information quickly from an image at one glance. How-
ever, challenges such as parallax errors make image captioning
a complex problem that is not fully resolved. This error can
make it difficult for the human eye and computer vision sys-
tems to detect objects at certain angles where their appearance
changes, making them hard to recognize. In addition, objects
of the same class might have various shapes and appearances
from different angles, further complicating the task. Overlap-
ping objects and scene clutter also pose challenges for accurate
object detection [7].
