The Microsoft COCO (MS COCO) dataset [123] is a large-
scale benchmark widely used in image recognition, object de-
tection, semantic segmentation, and image captioning. Each
image is manually annotated via Amazon Mechanical Turk and
includes objects from over 100 categories, representing real-
world scenes with natural backgrounds. The dataset contains
82,783 training images, 40,504 validation images, and 40,775
test images with undisclosed labels. Each image is paired with
five descriptive captions, making MS COCO a key resource for
evaluating image captioning models.
