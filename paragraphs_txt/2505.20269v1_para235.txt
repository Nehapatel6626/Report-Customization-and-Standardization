Explanations for the outputs of ANNs are fundamental in many scenarios,
due to critical systems, data protection laws, adversarial examples, among
others. Therefore, several heuristic methods have been developed to provide
explanations for the decisions made by ANNs. However, these approaches
lack guarantees of correctness and may also produce redundant explanations.
Logic-based approaches address these issues but often suffer from scalability
problems.
