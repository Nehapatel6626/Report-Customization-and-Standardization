Machine learning is programming computers to optimize a performance criterion using example data or past experience.
There is no need to “learn” to calculate payroll
Learning is used when:
Human expertise does not exist (navigating on Mars),
Humans are unable to explain their expertise (speech recognition)
Solution changes in time (routing on a computer network)
Solution needs to be adapted to particular cases (user biometrics)
