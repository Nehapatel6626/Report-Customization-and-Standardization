In the context of image captioning, [106] proposed a Multi-
Gate Attention (MGA) block within a pre-layer norm trans-
former architecture. This architecture modifies the standard
self-attention mechanism by incorporating multiple gate mech-
anisms, thus enhancing its capabilities. The pre-layer norm
transformer architecture differs from the original transformer
architecture in that the layer normalization is placed before the
self-attention module, and the feedforward layer and subsequent
layers are eliminated. This simplification aims to increase the
modelâ€™s efficiency for image captioning.
