incisions,
suturing, etc. The robot does not know the optimal actions
initially but gradually learns by experimenting with different
actions, observing their outcomes (e.g., successful incision,
minimal damage to tissue, or better healing outcomes), and
adjusting its strategy based on these results. Each hospital or
centre can train its RL model using local patient data (e.g.,
from its surgeries) and share model updates (e.g., gradients
or weights) with a central server. The server aggregates these
updates into a global model, which is then sent back to the
hospitals for further improvement. The key advantage here is
that the data never leaves the local institution, ensuring privacy
and security, but the model is still able to learn from a large,
diverse set of data across multiple hospitals.
