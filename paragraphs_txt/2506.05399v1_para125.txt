Expanding on this, [41] investigates the application of Vi-
sion Transformers (ViTs) in the medical domain. Initially in-
spired by the success of Transformer networks in language pro-
cessing, ViTs have emerged as a powerful alternative to CNNs
for computer vision tasks. These models and their variants ex-
cel at capturing long-range dependencies and spatial correla-
tions, offering substantial benefits for medical image analysis
tasks, including classification, segmentation, registration, de-
tection, and radiological report generation. The paper specifi-
cally discusses the role of transformers in medical image cap-
tioning and disease diagnosis, providing insights into commonly
used medical imaging modalities in clinical practice. Further-
more, it reviews the self-attention mechanism in vision trans-
formers as applied to disease diagnosis and automated report
generation. The study concludes by identifying existing chal-
lenges in the field and suggesting potential future research di-
rections to enhance the efficiency of AI-driven applications in
healthcare.
