Additionally, the input information from the distribution designer may be passed to our third module, the DDODB branch-and-bound module. This module represents an alternative approach to the heuristic module, and obtains (at a high execution cost) the best fragmentation schema for a given database application. The branch-and-bound procedure searches for an optimal solution in the space of potentially good fragmentation schemas for an application and outputs its result to the distribution designer. The algorithm bounds its search for the best fragmentation schema by using a query processing cost function during the evaluation of each fragmentation schema in the hypotheses space. This cost function, defined in [30], is responsible for estimating the execution cost of queries on top of a distributed database. The resulting fragmentation schema generated by the heuristic module is used to bound evaluations of fragmentation schemas presenting higher estimated costs. Finally, the resulting fragmentation schema generated by the branch-and-bound algorithm, as well as the fragmentation schemas discarded during the search, may generate examples (positive or negative) to the TREND3 module, thus incorporating the branch-and-bound results into the DDODB heuristic module.
