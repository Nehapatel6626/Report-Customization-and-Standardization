Current multi-agent systems (MAS) primarily function as
integration platforms for coordinating multiple LLMs. No-
table frameworks include Microsoftâ€™s AutoGen (Wu et al.,
2024), the Multi-LLM Agent Debate Framework (Du et al.,
2023; Chang, 2023; 2024a;b), LangGraph and CrewAI
(LangChain AI, 2024; Moura, 2024), XAgent (Xia et al.,
2023), and CAMEL (Li et al., 2023). While these frame-
works excel in agent coordination, they prioritize task dis-
tribution over the comprehensive constraint management
necessary for complex planning.
