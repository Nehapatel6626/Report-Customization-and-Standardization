Future work will include applying TREND3 to other applications, and the generation of examples to the TREND3 module using the branch-and-bound module to address the lack of performance results on top of distributed databases in the literature. Also, we intend to enhance the FORTE system to deal with negation as failure, extending the ideas already mentioned in previous works of our group [1,16].
