The second scheme was to assist with memorization of vocabulary words. We only considered words whose meanings could be captured by a single synonym, such as ‘obstinacy == tenacity’. We further cherry-picked only those words that contained the first letter of the synonym word, ‘obstinacy’ for example contains ‘t’. We then formed an utterance that ended with the synonym word, where the first letters of each word formed a prefix of the word being defined. For our ‘obstinacy’ example, ‘oh but such tenacity’ is such an utterance (also generated from the Jane Austen corpus).  If the synonym letter came too late in the word being defined, such that we felt that the mnemonic would too long to be useful, we tried to put the synonym word earlier, hoping that the beginning of the sentence would be enough to help the person remember it, e.g. for ‘aphorism == maxim’, ‘all people have one maxim’.
