Two key limitations emerge: 1) Attention narrowing: Over-
focus on objectives (e.g., arrival times) causes neglect of
critical constraints (e.g., ﬁre safety); and 2) Solution rigid-
ity: Once a constraint is satisﬁed (e.g., assigning Sarah to
oven duty), LLMs treat it as a ﬁxed context, failing to ex-
plore alternatives.
