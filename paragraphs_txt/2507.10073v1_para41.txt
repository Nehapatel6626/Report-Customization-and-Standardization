Cultural Persona Prompting We intend to assess synthetic surveys and evaluate the
alignment between participants and language models. Thus, we opt for a simple prompt
containing only the task and an optional persona stating the distinct cultural contexts. With
the reduction to the keywords of the geographical origin, we force the system to tap into its
built-in concepts [wei2021finetuned] without modifying them heavily in-context and thus,
introducing our observation biases [bostrom2013anthropic].
