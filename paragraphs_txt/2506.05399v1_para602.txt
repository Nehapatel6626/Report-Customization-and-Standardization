The development of image captioning models faces several
challenges, including exploding gradients and the generation
of incorrect sentences. Most modern algorithms rely on Re-
current Neural Networks and Long-Short-Term Memory Net-
works, which can suffer from vanished gradients and require
significant resources, making them less hardware-friendly [84].
Although Generative Adversarial Networks [97] offer a promis-
ing alternative, they come with their own set of issues, such
as the difficulty of training due to the discrete nature of GAN
[129, 130]. Another approach involves using semantic feature
vectors or focusing on object-region relationships [131] or fo-
cusing on object-region relationships [6] [53] [5].
