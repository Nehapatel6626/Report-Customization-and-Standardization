medicine, offering a paradigm shift from traditional
open surgery to minimally invasive procedures. This transi-
tion has led to significant advancements, including enhanced
surgical precision, diminished patient trauma, reduced post-
operative complications, and accelerated recovery times [1]–
[3]. Augmenting Robotic-Assisted Surgery (RAS) platforms
with Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the next frontier, promis-
ing to further enhance surgical capabilities and autonomy.
Specifically, the integration of AI can enable surgical robots
to perform complex tasks with greater dexterity, adapt
to
unforeseen intraoperative events, and provide surgeons with
real-time decision support [4]–[7].
