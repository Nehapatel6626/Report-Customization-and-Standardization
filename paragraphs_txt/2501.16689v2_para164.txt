The repository’s standardized agent speciﬁcations and
matching mechanism enable MACI to scale efﬁciently
across domains. By leveraging modular designs and pro-
tocol buffers, new agents can be integrated seamlessly into
existing workﬂows, ensuring adaptability and extensibility
without compromising performance or consistency.
