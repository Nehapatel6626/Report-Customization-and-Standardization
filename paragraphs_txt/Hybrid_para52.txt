The idea is simple. In the learning phase, the Hybrid Classifier grows a tree exactly like the Decision Tree. The only difference is at the leaves, where a naive Bayes learner is now implemented. This Naive Bayes learner learns only on the training examples that arrive at that particular leaf, using only those attributes that have not been used by the Decision Tree along the path from the root to the leaf. During the inference phase, just as in Decision Trees, the attribute values of the test example determine the path that it takes down the tree and hence the particular leaf node that it reaches. The decision at the leaf node is taken by the Naive Bayes classifier based on the attributes of the
