Section 2 examines related work, while Section 3 contains the details of decision trees and their construction process. Section 4 discusses the naïve Bayes approach and Section 5 discusses techniques used for improving the performance of the naïve Bayes and the decision tree techniques.  Section 6 proposes our novel hybrid technique and explains the intuition and the need for such an approach. In section 7 we evaluate the naïve Bayes and Decision Tree classifier and the effect of various improvements. Experiments also show that the Hybrid inherits desirable properties from both classifiers. We conclude and discuss future work in Section 8.
