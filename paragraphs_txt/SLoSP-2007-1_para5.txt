Assumes you come with some background…
Some probability, and statistics; knowledge of algorithms and their complexity, decent programming skills (if doing the course for credit)
Assumes you’ve seen some (Statistical) NLP before
Teaches key theory and methods for parsing and statistical parsing
The centroid of the course is generative models for treebank parsing
We extend out to related syntactic tasks and parsing methods, including discriminative parsing, nonlocal dependencies, treebank structure.
