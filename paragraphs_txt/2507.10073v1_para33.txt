The concept of embodied cognition becomes paramount in understanding these limitations.
Human understanding is not merely a computational process but a deeply integrated experi-
ence that involves sensory perception, emotional processing, and contextual interpretation.
LLMs, by contrast, operate through abstract mathematical representations that fundamentally
disconnect language from lived experience. As researchers, we must approach LLM-based
synthetic characters with a critical lens, recognizing them as sophisticated simulation tools
rather than genuine human proxies. The promise of these technologies lies not in their ability
to replace human subjects, but in their potential to augment and expand our understanding
of complex social phenomena.
