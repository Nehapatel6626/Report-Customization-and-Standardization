In their work, [114] proposed a new method called Re-
flective Decoding Network (RDN) to enhance image caption-
ing systems. Unlike traditional models, which often employ
a single-stage decoding process that may not fully utilize the
context and finer details of the visual input, RDN involves a
two-step decoding process. In the first stage, a reflective mech-
anism generates an initial caption, followed by a second stage
to refine it. This reflective decoding process employs a self-
attention-based approach to review and modify the original cap-
tion, considering the visual elements and previously generated
words. This iterative refinement results in improved captioning
output from the model.
