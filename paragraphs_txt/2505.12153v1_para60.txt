without centralising sensitive patient data. We present a novel
framework where multiple hospitals participate in FDRL as
shown in Fig. 1. One hospital may have extensive experience
with spinal surgery, while another specializes in minimally
invasive cardiac surgery. Using FL, each hospital can train an
RL policy on its local data for its specific procedures. The
global RL model, aggregated through FL, can then dynami-
cally choose the most relevant policy when faced with a new
patient, considering factors like the type of surgery, patient
health metrics, and historical performance of certain policies.
For example, if the robot is performing cardiac surgery, the RL
model might select a policy trained specifically for minimal
invasiveness and precise tool movements. If a more complex
procedure like spinal surgery is required, the model could
switch to a policy designed for more extensive interventions,
accounting for the different surgical requirements.
