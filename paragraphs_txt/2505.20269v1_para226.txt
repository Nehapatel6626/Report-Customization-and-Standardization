With respect to the average running time for building the logical constraints,
our adaptation generally outperformed the encoding by Fischetti and Jo [5].
However, there were exceptions noted, such as in the spect dataset. Overall, our
adaptation achieved an improvement of up to 18% compared to the the other one,
as seen in the heart-statlog dataset. In summary, the results indicate that our
adaptation is consistently more efficient than the other approach for building
logical constraints. The variability in the results, as shown by the standard
deviations, further supports this conclusion. For instance, the average running
time of our proposal is less than the average minus the standard deviation of the
other approach in 9 out of 12 datasets. These cases are highlighted in bold in
Table 1. It is important to note that, in the spect dataset, the average running
time of the encoding proposed by Fischetti and Jo [5] is less than the average
minus the standard deviation of our adaptation. This indicates that, while our
proposal appears generally more efficient, specific dataset characteristics can
influence which encoding is more advantageous. Our adaptation yielded notably
superior results not only in the average time for building logical constraints
but also in the overall time, which includes both computing explanations and
constructing logical constraints. For instance, it achieved an improvement of up
to 16% compared to the other approach, as seen in the heart-statlog dataset.
