We compare our FDRL framework with a centralized RL
framework as a baseline (where all policies are pooled to-
gether) for privacy effectiveness using the following privacy
metrics. Additionally, we introduce an experimental evaluation
that systematically analyzes how different privacy settings (ϵ,
σ2) impact surgical performance in terms of accuracy, safety,
and adaptability. A privacy utility tradeoff plot is included to
evaluate how privacy constraints influence surgical precision,
task success rates, and training efficiency.
