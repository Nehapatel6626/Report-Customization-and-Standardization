Similarly, [40] presents an analysis of transformer networks
in computer vision, with a special emphasis on their applica-
tions in natural and medical image analysis. Although trans-
formers were initially designed for natural language process-
ing, their recent adaptation to image-based tasks has demon-
strated promising results, positioning them as a viable alterna-
tive to traditional convolutional neural networks. The review
highlights core principles of the transformerâ€™s attention mecha-
nism, which enables effective long-range feature extraction. It
explores various transformer-based architectures applied to crit-
ical tasks such as image segmentation, classification, registra-
tion, and diagnosis. The paper also highlights the current limi-
tations of transformer networks in image analysis and outlines
potential research directions to enhance their effectiveness, par-
ticularly in the context of medical imaging.
