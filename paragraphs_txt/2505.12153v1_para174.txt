Secure aggregation in the FDRL framework relies on HE
and SMPC to protect model updates. The computational
complexity of each stage is analyzed as follows. In the local
training stage, each hospital updates its RL policy using DP-
SGD, which requires O(E|Di|) operations per round. Addi-
tionally, noise injection and encryption introduce an overhead
of O(|Di|). In the secure aggregation stage,HE for weighted
averaging incurs a complexity of O(N log N ), while decryp-
tion at the global server is performed in O(log N ). Secure
multi-party summation operations contribute an additional
complexity of O(N ) per aggregation round. Finally, in the
dynamic policy selection stage, evaluating all policies incurs
a complexity of O(N ), whereas selecting the optimal meta-
learning policy requires O(N log N ) operations.
