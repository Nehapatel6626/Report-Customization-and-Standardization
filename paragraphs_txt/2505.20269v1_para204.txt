We used Python to implement the approaches and to run the experiments.
TensorFlow was used to manipulate ANNs, including the training and testing
steps. CPLEX was used as the MILP solver and accessed by the DOcplex library.
We used 12 datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository2 and Penn
Machine Learning Benchmarks3, each ranging from 9 to 32 integer, continuous,
categorical or binary features. The number of instances in the selected datasets
ranges from 156 to 691. The types of classification problems related to
these datasets are binary and multi-class classification. The preprocessing
performed on the datasets included one-hot encoding of the categorical data and
normalization of the continuous features to the range [0, 1]. This normalization
was not applied to the integer features to avoid transforming their space into
continuous, which could compromise formal guarantees on the correctness of the
algorithm. As far as we know, such a methodology was not considered in earlier
works.
