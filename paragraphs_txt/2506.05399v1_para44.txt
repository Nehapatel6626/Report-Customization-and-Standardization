The review by [32] examines the advancements in image
captioning, tracing its evolution from traditional ML techniques
to modern deep learning-based approaches. The study intro-
duces a structured taxonomy for classifying image captioning
methodologies and highlights key developments, including tem-
plate-based, retrieval-based, and encoder-decoder models. De-
spite significant progress, the authors emphasize that further re-
search is needed to develop more reliable and adaptable models.
Similarly, [33] explores the evolution and persistent challenges
of image captioning across various application domains, such as
multimodal search engines, security, remote sensing, medical
imaging, and assistive technologies. The study underscores the
ongoing difficulties in achieving real-time captioning in critical
fields like healthcare and security and the limited availability of
large, domain-specific datasets. Additionally, issues related to
training and evaluation continue to pose obstacles. While sig-
nificant advancements have been made, the authors stress the
need for continued research to enhance the robustness and prac-
ticality of image captioning models. In another survey by [34],
the authors focus specifically on attention-based image caption-
ing, reviewing the major breakthroughs in this area. The paper
presents a new taxonomy for classifying attention-based tech-
niques and discusses the challenges that hinder further develop-
ment.
