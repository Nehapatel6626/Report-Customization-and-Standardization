To address the issues of exploding and vanishing gradients
in RNN, a proposed method was introduced by [69]. The model
was built upon an encoder-decoder architecture, utilizing CNN
for image description and GRU (gated recurrent units) for text
generation. The GRU decoder utilized an image feature vector
extracted by CNN and information from the scores of phrase
weights. Two methods were applied to generate the scores. The
first method used the part-of-speech (PoS) technique to produce
scores based on word classes, while the second method uti-
lized a likelihood function measured by the Euclidean distance.
The results indicated that the PoS approach outperformed the
model.
