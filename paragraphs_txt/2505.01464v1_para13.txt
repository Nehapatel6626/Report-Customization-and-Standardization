Existing theories of Artificial Intelligence (AI) consciousness rely on symbolic broadcast, as
proposed by Baars [3], perceptual prediction models from Friston [4], Manzotti [7] argues
that embodied cognition theories, which emphasize the role of physical interaction with the
environment, have significantly shaped perspectives on AI and consciousness, The Human
Brain Project [5] emphasizes that cognition evolved through physical embodiment, contrast-
ing this with disembodied AI systems that lack sensory-motor grounding.
