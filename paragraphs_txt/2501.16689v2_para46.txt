dependency graphs that encode inter-agent constraints, en-
suring precise role allocation while maintaining global fea-
sibility. Meanwhile, validation agents, operating indepen-
dently of the planning process, monitor for errors and in-
consistencies stemming from probabilistic output, ensuring
alignment with task objectives. This separation of roles mit-
igates cognitive tunneling and enhances adaptability, allow-
ing MACI to dynamically respond to real-time disruptions
such as resource shortages or environmental changes.
