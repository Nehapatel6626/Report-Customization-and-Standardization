ROSA’s implementation does not provide generic monitor nodes. They should be implemented as needed
for each application with the requirement that they publish the monitored information in the /diagnostics
topic7 with the standard ROS DiagnosticArray message format. When a monitor node sends measurement
updates to the KB, the message field in the DiagnosticStatus message needs to be set to ‘QA measurement’
or ‘EA measurement’, and when sending component status updates (e.g., that the component is in failure),
the message field must be set to ‘Component status’. When the KB receives monitoring data, it sends an
event message in the ‘/events’ topic to inform that monitoring data was written in the KB.
