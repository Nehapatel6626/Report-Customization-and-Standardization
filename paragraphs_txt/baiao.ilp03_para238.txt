This work presented a knowledge-based approach for automatically improving a heuristic DDODB algorithm through the use of theory revision. This approach is part of the framework that handles the class fragmentation problem of the design of distributed databases. The proposed framework integrates three modules: the DDODB heuristic module, the theory revision module (called TREND3) and the DDODB branch-and-bound module.
