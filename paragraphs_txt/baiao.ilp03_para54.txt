Related works in the literature [10, 11] presented a detailed comparison among many theory refinement systems in the literature, concentrating in theory revision systems, which - in general - have better results than theory-guided systems. The analysis included systems such as FORTE [29], A3 [33] and PTR+ [22]. The author proposed a framework for classifying theory revision systems and a methodology for evaluating how well an algorithm is able to identify the location of errors independently of its ability to repair them. The performance analysis on the FORTE system when compared to other in different domains demonstrated that it searches a larger space of revised theories, and thus may find a more accurate candidate than either PTR+ or A3. Also, FORTE attempts to repair many more revision points than other systems, because it generates and evaluates more repair candidates. Therefore, the FORTE system was chosen to perform the improvement procedure of our DDODB algorithms.
