To capture the decision criteria on how to select an adaptation, the priority attribute can be used to
express the order of priority for selecting each function design or component configuration.
For more complex criteria, the estimation relationship can be used to capture the estimated impact of
selecting a function design, Component, or component configuration on the measured values
of Measures. Furthermore, a required action can relate to a Measure to indicate the preferred
estimation when selecting a configuration for that action. At runtime, the configuration planner
component exploits this knowledge to decide which configuration to select.
