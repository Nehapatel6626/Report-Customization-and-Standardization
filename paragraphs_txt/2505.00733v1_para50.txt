Despite advances in self-adaptive robotic systems, fully addressing task and architectural co-adaptation
(TACA) with reusable and scalable solutions remains an open challenge. While some studies explore the
relationship between task execution and architectural adaptation, only a few explicitly address TACAâ€”and
those that do face limitations in reusability and practical applicability in robotics. This work aims to
bridge this gap by introducing a knowledge-based framework that can capture the necessary knowledge to
solve TACA across different use cases, can be directly applied to robotic systems, and supports modular
modifications for incorporating different adaptation strategies.
