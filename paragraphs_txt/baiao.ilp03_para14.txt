The paper is organized as follows: in section 2, the design of distributed databases is defined and our framework for the design of distributed databases is described. Theory revision is briefly reviewed in section 3, while in section 4 we show how to improve a DDODB analysis algorithm through the use of the FORTE system. Experimental results on top of the OO7 benchmark [12] are presented in section 5. Finally, section 6 presents some conclusions and future work.
