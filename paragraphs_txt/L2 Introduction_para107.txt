Increasing trust in DNN classification by reporting more than class assignment.
Both A and B are members of class 1 and correctly classified.
Explainer algorithm reports distance to decision boundary.
More trust in result for A than B because further from decision boundary
Noise is less likely to be factor in assignment of A to class 1
