One useful feature of a doubly linked list is its elimination of the need for a pointer to a node's predecessor to delete the node.
Through the back member, we can alter the next member of the preceding node to make it jump over the unwanted node. 
Then we make the back pointer of the succeeding node point to the preceding node.
