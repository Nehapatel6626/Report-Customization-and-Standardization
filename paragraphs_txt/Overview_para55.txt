Two targeted goals behind your experiments:
First, verify that the method works. 
Test the method using various data sets. 
Second, identify potential weaknesses of the method chosen and maybe think of possible improvements.
Identify cases where the method might fail to produce good results. 
Demonstrate this using data that actually make the method fail or perform poorly.
