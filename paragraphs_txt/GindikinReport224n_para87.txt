This system was designed to generate sensible mnemonic devices based on certain specifications provided by the user.  This seems to be a logical condition for usage due to the nature of the application: to produce a memory aid that is easy to remember.  A user might want to generate a mnemonic device from a collection of words that are commonly themed or come from a specific text source.  For example, it is sensible to remember a word like “amendment” by using words from political texts.  This is a way that the system can be customized to the preference of the user.
