Common Goals:
Heterogeneity – can the system handle a large variety of types of PCs and devices?
Robustness – is the system resilient to host crashes and failures, and to the network dropping messages? 
Availability – are data+services always there for clients?
Transparency – can the system hide its internal workings from the users?
Concurrency – can the server handle multiple clients simultaneously?
Efficiency – is the service fast enough? Does it utilize 100% of all resources?
Scalability – can it handle 100 million nodes without degrading service? (nodes=clients and/or servers) How about 6 B? More?
Security – can the system withstand hacker attacks?
Openness – is the system extensible?
(Also: consistency, CAP, partition-tolerance, ACID, BASE, and others … )
