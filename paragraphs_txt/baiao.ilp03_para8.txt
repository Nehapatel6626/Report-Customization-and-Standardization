Distributed and parallel processing on database management systems are efficient ways of improving performance of applications that manipulate large volumes of data. This may be accomplished by removing irrelevant data accessed during the execution of queries and by reducing the data exchange among sites, which are the two main goals of the design of distributed databases [28]. However, in order to improve performance of these applications, it is very important to design information distribution properly.
