Thruster failure (U1) was solved with structural adaptation by including two possible function
designs of the maintain motion function. Runtime behavior: when a thruster fails, the maintain function
design status is set to unfeasible (see Figure 3d), and it cannot be selected anymore. Then, the recover
function design is selected, and the recover thruster node component is activated. If all thrusters are
recovered, the maintain function design status becomes feasible and is selected again.
