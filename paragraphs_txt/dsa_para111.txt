Any component of the array can be inspected or updated by using its index. 
This is an efficient operation 
O(1) = constant time
The array indices may be integers (C, Java) or other discrete data types (Pascal, Ada).
The lower bound may be zero (C, Java), one (Fortran), or chosen by the programmer (Pascal, Ada)
