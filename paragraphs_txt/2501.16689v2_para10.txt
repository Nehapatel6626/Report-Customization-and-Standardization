Advancing artiﬁcial intelligence requires capabilities be-
yond pattern matching. To tackle complex real-world tasks,
AI must exhibit deliberate reasoning, temporal awareness,
and effective constraint management. While Large Lan-
guage Models (LLMs) excel at pattern recognition, they
face signiﬁcant challenges in planning tasks that demand
sustained attention, comprehensive constraint awareness,
and reasoning across both past and future temporal states
(Kahneman, 2011).
