A technology that satisfies all representation requirements is TypeDB (Dorn and Pribadi, 2023, 2024).
TypeDB is a polymorphic database based on type theory that implements the polymorphic entity-relation-
attribute (PERA) Dorn and Pribadi (2024) data model. The PERA model subsumes the CDM used as
the meta-model for the proposed ROSA model, allowing it to be implemented without modifications.
Furthermore, TypeDB has a reasoning system that is able to reason over rules of the form antecedent â‡’
consequent to infer new facts at query time. Where antecedent represents a precondition for inferring
the consequent and is expressed as a first-order logic expression combining elements from the model
(i.e., entities, relationships, and individuals), and the consequent is a single new fact inferred when the
antecedent holds true. The ROSA model rules presented in Figure 3 can be implemented with TypeDB
without modifications. For these reasons, this work uses TypeDB to implement the proposed knowledge
model and rules.
