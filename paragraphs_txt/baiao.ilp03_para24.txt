In the object oriented data model, additional issues contribute to increase the difficulty of the class fragmentation and turn it into an even more complex problem. Our previous work proposed a set of heuristics implemented by an algorithm (called “analysis algorithm”) [2]. Some examples of the heuristics proposed are “in the case of a selection operation on a class with a large cardinality, this class is indicated to primary horizontal fragmentation”, or “in the case of a projection operation on a class with a large cardinality that is not derived horizontally fragmented, this class is indicated to vertical fragmentation”. The algorithm was also capable of handling conflicts during the fragmentation schema definition.
