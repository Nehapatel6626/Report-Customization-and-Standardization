Despite the higher computational overhead introduced by
HE compared to standard averaging techniques, the privacy-
security tradeoff ensures that patient data confidentiality is
preserved without direct exposure. The optimization of policy
selection Minimises computational costs, enabling real-time
decision-making in RAS. The proposed FDRL framework
remains computationally feasible for real-world deployment,
striking a balance between privacy preservation and model
efficiency. Future research will explore hardware acceleration
techniques, such as quantized FL and edge computing integra-
tion, to further reduce computational overhead and improve
scalability.
