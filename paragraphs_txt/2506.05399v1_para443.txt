The Myanmar image captions corpus, developed by [84],
was built using a subset of the Flickr8K dataset, which ini-
tially contains 8,092 images, each with five English captions.
Due to time constraints, 3,000 images were selected, and five
Myanmar-language captions were created for each image, to-
taling 15,000 captions. The dataset was constructed using two
approaches: First, English captions were translated into Myan-
mar using an attention-based neural machine translation model,
achieving a multi-BLEU score rate 13.93. Second, native speak-
ers directly described the images in Myanmar, resulting in a
vocabulary size of 3,138 words, with the longest caption con-
taining 21 words. The dataset was divided into 2,500 images
for training, 300 for validation, and 200 for testing.
