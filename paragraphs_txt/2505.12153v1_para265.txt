indicated by a shift towards warmer colours, while accuracy
declines, reflected by a transition towards cooler colours. This
visualization effectively demonstrates the privacy-utility trade-
off inherent in differentially private FL higher noise ensures
stronger privacy guarantees but comes at the cost of reduced
model accuracy, and vice versa. Fig. 5 demonstrates the perfor-
mance differences between FL and CL across four key evalu-
ation metrics in privacy-preserving RAS. The selected metrics
Task-Specific Accuracy, Surgical Risk Mitigation, PLR, and
OPE offer a comprehensive assessment of both approaches.
