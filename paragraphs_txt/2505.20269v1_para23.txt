to 18%. Surprisingly, both methods exhibit similar running times for computing
explanations. Furthermore, our adaptation outperforms the other encoding in
the overall time, encompassing both building logical constraints and computing
explanations. In this case, the results indicate an improvement of up to 16%. In
summary, our main contributions are described in the following:
