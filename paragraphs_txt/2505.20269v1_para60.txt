In the MILP in (2), we want to find values for variables x1, y1, s1, z1
minimizing the value of the objective function y1 among all values that satisfy
the constraints. Variable z1 is binary since z1 ∈ {0, 1} is a constraint in the
MILP, while variables x1, y1, s1 have the real numbers R as their domain. The
constraints in a MILP may appear as linear equations, linear inequalities, and
indicator constraints. Indicator constraints can be seen as logical implications of
the form z = v → (cid:80)n
i=1 wixi ≤ b such that z is a binary variable, v is a constant
0 or 1 [3].
