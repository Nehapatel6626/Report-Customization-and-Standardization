Mitigation, which measures the ability to Minimise errors and
improve procedural safety, is 15.2% higher in FL than in CL.
This indicates that FL-trained models adapt more effectively
to dynamic surgical environments, potentially reducing risks
during real-world deployment. Additionally, PLR is reduced
by 60% in FL, highlighting its advantage in securing sensitive
patient data. Unlike CL, which requires direct data aggregation
and exposes information to central repositories, FL performs
decentralized learning, inherently enhancing privacy preserva-
tion.
