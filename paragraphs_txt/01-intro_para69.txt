Neural nets vs AI
McCulloch & Pitts 1943
Died out in 1960’s, revived in 1980’s
Neural nets vastly simplified model of real neurons, but still useful & practical – massive parallelism
particular family of learning and representation techniques
Logic vs Probability
In 1950’s logic seemed more computationally & expressively attractive (McCarthy, Newell)
attempts to extend logic “just a little” to deal with the fact that the world is uncertain!
1988 – Judea Pearl’s work on Bayes nets 
provided efficient computational framework 
Today – no longer rivals
