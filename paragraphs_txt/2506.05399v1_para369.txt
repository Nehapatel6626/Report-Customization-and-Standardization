(LSTNet) to facilitate local object recognition during caption-
ing. They also employed layer-specific fusion (LSF) for cross-
layer semantic complement, combining information from mul-
tiple encoder layers. The experimental results demonstrated
that LSTNetâ€™s local visual modeling outperformed many state-
of-the-art captioning models.
