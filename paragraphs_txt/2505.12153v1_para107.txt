2) Surgical Risk Mitigation Score: An essential criterion
for selecting an optimal surgical RL policy is its ability
to Minimise risk during robotic-assisted procedures. Surgical
risks primarily arise from excessive force application, unin-
tended tissue damage, and critical surgical errors. To evaluate
a policyâ€™s safety and reliability, we introduce the surgical risk
mitigation score (Rmit), which provides a quantitative measure
of risk reduction.
