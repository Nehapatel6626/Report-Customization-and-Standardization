To promote reusability, composability, and extensibility, the architecture is designed with the following
premises: (1) all knowledge required for the adaptation logic is captured in the central KB, (2) there is
no inter-component communication between the MAPE components (Weyns et al., 2013), (3) the MAPE
components insert and read data from or to the KB via standardized interfaces, and (4) there is no explicit
coordination between the MAPE-K components. Premise 1 promotes reusability by only requiring the
modeling of the relevant knowledge for applying ROSA to different applications in a single model. Premises
1 to 4 promote composability and extensibility by allowing the MAPE components to be stateless and
self-contained.
