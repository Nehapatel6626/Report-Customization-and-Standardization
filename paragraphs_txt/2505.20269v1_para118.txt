x,i are
defined by isolating variable xl
i from other constraints in subsequent layers. Then,
xl
i is maximized to find its upper bound. A similar process is applied to find the
bounds ubl
i. This optimization is possible due to the bounds of
the features. Furthermore, these bounds can assist the solver in accelerating the
computation of explanations. Therefore, the time required for this process must
be considered when building F .
