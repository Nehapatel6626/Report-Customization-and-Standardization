may affect the quality of the generated captions [2]. The effec-
tiveness of attention mechanisms in deep learning models has
led researchers to emphasize their importance in image caption-
ing [31]. Fig. 6 shows changes in attention over time as the
model generates each word to reflect the relevant parts of the
image [51].
