the minimum water visibility in which the configuration can be used. Runtime behavior: if the measured
water visibility is higher than 3.25, the component configuration High is selected since it has priority
number one. If the water visibility drops below 3.25, its constraint status is set to violated (see Figure 3a),
and, consequently, its status is set to unfeasible (see Figure 3b). Depending on the water visibility, the
component configuration Medium or Low is then selected. If the water visibility increases again above 3.25,
the High component configuration status becomes feasible and is selected.
