The text sources used to extract the words necessary to build sentences were based from four collections of text: 1. Novels from Jane Austen, 2. Works from William Shakespeare, 3. Excerpts from The Wall Street Journal, and 4. The Bible.  These documents, especially the excerpts from The Wall Street Journal, required extensive prefiltering to remove utility information that was not useful in creating the language model necessary to generate the sentences for the mnemonic devices.  Punctuation marks were not completely removed from these sources since they proved to be valuable in allowing the system to produce sensible sentences using the language model.  Since the language model relied on frequency bigram occurrences to quantify the likelihood that random string sequences were parts of sentences, the punctuation marks provided additional information to the system.
