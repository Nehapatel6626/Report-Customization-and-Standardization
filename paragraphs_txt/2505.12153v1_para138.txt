To address this, we incorporated weighted local updates
(Eq. 3), with a regularisation term Î» that penalises divergence
between local models and the global model. Furthermore, we
simulated varying levels of non-IID environments by adjusting
the heterogeneity factor from 0 (Independent and Identically
Distributed (IID)) to 1 (highly non-IID), demonstrating that the
proposed FDRL framework consistently maintains a stable ac-
curacy of > 92%, even under severe heterogeneity conditions.
