In this paper, we studied quantum algorithm performance improvement techniques in 
transpilation, optimization, error mitigation, and machine learning. An approximation- 
based novel optimization technique is proposed. The proposed AQFT algorithm improves 
performance in addition to exponential speedups for QFT computation.
