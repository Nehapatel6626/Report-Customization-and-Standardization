Abstract. Anti-analysis techniques, particularly packing, challenge mal-
ware analysts, making packer identification fundamental. Existing packer
identifiers have significant limitations: signature-based methods lack flex-
ibility and struggle against dynamic evasion, while Machine Learning ap-
proaches require extensive training data, limiting scalability and adapt-
ability. Consequently, achieving accurate and adaptable packer identifica-
tion remains an open problem. This paper presents PackHero, a scalable
and efficient methodology for identifying packers using a novel static ap-
proach. PackHero employs a Graph Matching Network and clustering to
match and group Call Graphs from programs packed with known pack-
ers. We evaluate our approach on a public dataset of malware and be-
nign samples packed with various packers, demonstrating its effectiveness
and scalability across varying sample sizes. PackHero achieves a macro-
average F1-score of 93.7% with just 10 samples per packer, improving
to 98.3% with 100 samples. Notably, PackHero requires fewer samples to
achieve stable performance compared to other Machine Learning-based
tools. Overall, PackHero matches the performance of State-of-the-art
signature-based tools, outperforming them in handling Virtualization-
based packers such as Themida/Winlicense, with a recall of 100%.
