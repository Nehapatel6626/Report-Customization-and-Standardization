The mnemonics used in this system are used to allow the user to easily remember numerical and lexical information.  Mnemonics for these types of information can be generated through the use of key NLP concepts.  Sentences can be created that exploit the properties of items to be remembered.  A classic example of numerical information is the collection of digits found in the value of ÔÅ∞.  This system can produce sentences whose word lengths are determined by the digits to be remembered.
