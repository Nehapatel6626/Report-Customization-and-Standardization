We evaluate PackHero through the following four research questions:
RQ1. What is the minimum number of programs required for PackHero’s config-
uration to recognize packers effectively? In addition, once configured, is PackHero
able to recognize different packers?
RQ2. How does the clustering-based approach impact PackHero’s performance
and scalability compared to its non-clustering version?
RQ3. Given an already configured PackHero, how many samples does it require
to successfully integrate a new, unseen packer, and how does this integration
compare to other ML-based tools?
RQ4. Does PackHero perform better than signature-based tools?
