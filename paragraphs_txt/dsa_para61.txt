An ADT may be implemented by specific data types or data structures, in many ways and in many programming languages; or described in a formal specification language.
example, an abstract stack could be defined by three operations: 
push, that inserts some data item onto the structure, 
pop, that extracts an item from it, and 
peek, that allows data on top of the structure to be examined without removal.
