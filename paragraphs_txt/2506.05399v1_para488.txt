Calculating the longest common subsequence (LCS), the
longest matching sequence of words between the original and
predicted summaries, forms the basis of the ROUGE algorithm.
Unlike matching words consecutively, LCS allows for matches
that reflect the word order at the sentence level. Additionally,
LCS automatically includes common n-grams in sequence, re-
moving the need to calculate predetermined n-gram sequences.
Mathematically, ROUGE can be defined as
