Section 2.1, PackGenome extracts YARA rules by tracing instructions during
their execution. Consequently, it is likely to struggle with the evasive behaviors
introduced by Themida into the binary during the packing process. Additionally,
PackGenome appears to face challenges due to the inherent nature of this packer.
Indeed, the result suggests that both the signature itself and its automatic extrac-
tion encounter difficulties when dealing with this packer family. Finally, looking
at FPR, PackGenome confirms its issues with Themida/Winlicense but shows
in-line results for the other packers. PackHero demonstrates a low FPR on av-
erage, while DIE generates the fewest FPR.
Answer to RQ4. PackHero matches SotA signature-based tools in accuracy
and significantly outperforms them on VM-based packers with advanced evasive
behaviors like Themida/Winlicense, demonstrating our approachâ€™s effectiveness.
