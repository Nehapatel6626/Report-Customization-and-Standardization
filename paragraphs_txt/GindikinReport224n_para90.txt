In this project we created an automatic mnemonic generator. One of the most interesting things we discovered, was that the part of problem we thought would be the hardest -- generating good, natural language text, turned out to be surprisingly simple. Initially we thought that we would have to deal with things like word morphology, tense agreement, and conjugation, but we discovered, as stated in [6], that even a simple bigram model turned out to be sufficient.
