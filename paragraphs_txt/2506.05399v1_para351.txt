State-of-the-art techniques directly encode identified object
regions and utilize region features. However, this approach
presents challenges related to object relationships and the po-
tential for incorrect item detection. Significant computational
power is also required to compute region features, particularly
when using high-performing CNN-based detectors like Faster
R-CNN. The study by [100] addressed these issues by replac-
ing a CNN backbone with a transformer to overcome the draw-
backs of CNN-based detectors and reduce computational costs
for extracting initial features from input images.
