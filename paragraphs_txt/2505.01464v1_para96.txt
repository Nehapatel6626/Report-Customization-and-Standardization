The embedding space remains static, but activations in latent space deform as the system
aligns its internal state with logical necessity. The modelâ€™s output no longer reflects surface
token likelihood, but instead converges toward the configuration required to stabilize the
truth of what the tokens are within the latent structure, rather than what they represent
symbolically. Epistemic coherence is prioritized over statistical mimicry. See Friston [4].
