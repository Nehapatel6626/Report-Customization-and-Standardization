Unable to deal with empty categories: termination problem, unless rewriting empties as constituents is somehow restricted (but then it's generally incomplete)
Useless work: locally possible, but globally impossible.
Inefficient when there is great lexical ambiguity (grammar-driven control might help here)
Conversely, it is data-directed: it attempts to parse the words that are there.
Repeated work: anywhere there is common substructure
