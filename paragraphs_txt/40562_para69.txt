There are weekly homework assignments, which are outlined in your homework packet. Each one will help you complete your research project.  You will discuss the homework in lab every week â€“ typically on Thursday. In addition, you will have a small data set to analyze using a statistical analysis computer program (SPSS). You will be expected to calculate basic statistics using the program as an in-class assignment.
