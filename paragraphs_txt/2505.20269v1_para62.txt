An important observation is that a MILP problem without an objective
function corresponds to a satisfiability problem, as discussed in Section 2.1.
Given that
relies on logical
consequence, and considering the connection between satisfiability and logical
consequence, we employ a MILP solver
to address explanation tasks.
Additionally, throughout the construction of the MILP model, we utilize
optimization, specifically employing a MILP solver, to determine tight lower
and upper bounds for the neurons of ANNs.
