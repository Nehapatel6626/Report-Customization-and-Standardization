To validate MACI’s capabilities, two experiments tested
its effectiveness in adaptive planning and constraint man-
agement. The ﬁrst experiment, based on the Traveling
Salesperson Problem (TSP), demonstrated MACI’s ability
to generate globally optimized workﬂows that guide LLMs
in solving this classical problem. The second, a Thanksgiv-
ing Dinner Planning task, highlighted MACI’s ability to re-
solve intricate cross-thread dependencies and dynamically
adjust to evolving constraints.
