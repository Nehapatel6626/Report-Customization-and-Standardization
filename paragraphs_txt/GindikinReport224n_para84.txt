Initially we had the idea that for the vocabulary memorization task, we would generate not just simple utterances, but rhymes. Syllabic counts and rhyming lines of structured poetry can be viewed as simply additional constraints for the search, for example a limerick must have 5 lines, the first two and the last with 8 syllables, the 3rd and 4th with 5, with the rhyming scheme AABBA. That is the reason why we came up with such a flexible and general system of constraints, which may seem like overkill for simpler utterances we ended up generating. We dropped the idea, partly because of lack of time, but also partly because we felt that a limerick, or any other reasonable rhyme would be too long to be useful in memorization.
