The class fragmentation problem in the design of a distributed database is known to be an NP-hard problem [28]. There are a number of works in the literature addressing the horizontal [7, 14, 31] or vertical [6, 15] class fragmentation technique, but not both. Even when the designer decides to use a horizontal fragmentation algorithm to one class and a vertical fragmentation algorithm to another class, he is left with no assistance to make this decision. Our previous work proposed a set of heuristics to drive the choice of the fragmentation technique to be applied in each class of the database schema. Those heuristics were implemented in an algorithm called “analysis algorithm” [2], and were incorporated in a methodology that includes the analysis algorithm, horizontal and vertical class fragmentation algorithms adapted from the literature. Experimental results reported in [3, 4] show applications that were executed 3.4 times faster when applying the fragmentation schema resulted from our methodology, compared to other alternative fragmentation schemas proposed by other works in the literature.
