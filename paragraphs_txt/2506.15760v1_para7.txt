Quantum computing has advanced from computing using quantum chips alone to a quan- 
tum and High Performance Computing (HPC) hybrid approach with heterogeneous orches- 
tration, development tools such as transpiler services, to abstraction services which focus 
on  circuit  and  application  functions.  The  Quantum  Information  Software  Kit  (Qiskit) 
Code Assistant uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help programmers generate function- 
related block code [1, 2].
