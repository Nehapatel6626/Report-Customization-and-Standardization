Common Agents Common agents are designed to han-
dle foundational planning tasks that align with MACI’s
state space dimensions (Who, Where, When, What, Why).
These agents provide general-purpose functionality that en-
sures consistency, feasibility, and robustness across plan-
ning tasks. Their primary responsibilities include:
• Constraint Validation Agents: Ensure adherence to tem-
poral, spatial, and resource constraints by verifying the
feasibility of generated plans.
