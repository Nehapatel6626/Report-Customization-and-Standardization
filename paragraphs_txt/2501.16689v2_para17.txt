3. Lack of Common Sense Integration. LLMs often over-
look practical constraints that humans intuitively consider.
This deﬁciency becomes particularly evident in domains
that require real-world experience and understanding. In
travel planning, an LLM might generate a route without ac-
counting for airport security processing times. In logistics,
it may create schedules that ignore resource availability and
preparation windows. Without explicit, granular speciﬁca-
tions, these models produce plans that appear superﬁcially
coherent but remain impractical.
