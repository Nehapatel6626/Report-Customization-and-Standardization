This section proposes a knowledge-based approach for improving the DDODB analysis algorithm through the use of theory revision. The goal of applying this knowledge-based approach is to automatically incorporate in the analysis algorithm changes required to obtain better fragmentation schemas. These improvements may be found through additional experiments, thus the theory revision can automatically reflect the new heuristics implicit on these new results.
