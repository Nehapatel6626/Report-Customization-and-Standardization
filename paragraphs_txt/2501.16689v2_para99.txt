Diagnoses: Common-Sense Constraints and Isolated
Processing Syndrome Current LLM systems require ex-
plicit speciﬁcation of real-world constraints that humans
consider common sense, highlighting a limitation in their
planning capabilities. Furthermore, we identiﬁed what
we term isolated processing syndrome, where LLMs han-
dle sub-tasks independently without maintaining awareness
of overall constraints. This syndrome manifests itself in
two critical ways: the system either misses obvious opti-
mizations or proposes solutions that violate the stated con-
straints, leading to an infeasible or suboptimal plan.
