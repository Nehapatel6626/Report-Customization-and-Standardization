To measure ROSA’s development effort for each use case, we count the number of entities and
relationships contained in the models created for the use cases presented. To measure the BT managing
system development effort for SUAVE, we count the number of nodes contained in the BTs created to
solve it, and the number of modes and parameters included in the System Modes’ configuration file already
packaged in SUAVE. In the remainder of this paper, we denote the elements modeled in both approaches
as overhead.
