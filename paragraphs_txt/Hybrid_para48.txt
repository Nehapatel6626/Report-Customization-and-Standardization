A Naive Bayes Classifier is trivial to implement, requires little memory and is very quick to learn from a training set. Its biggest drawback however, is the large number of incorrect classifications it does when the attributes are dependent. If somehow the dependent attributes could be identified, and for each such pair, only one of them used both in the learning and the inferring stages, we might be able to cut down on the misclassifications.
