In most methods, the image is first fed into a CNN to gen-
erate image features, which will then be used as input for the
language processing component. The convolution layer reduces
the image into features by using information from nearby pix-
els. It then employs prediction layers to forecast the target val-
ues. This is achieved by creating a dot product using multiple
convolution filters, or kernels, which scan the image and ex-
tract unique aspects of the image. The max pooling layer helps
to reduce the spatial size of the convolved features and prevents
overfitting by providing an abstract representation of the con-
volved features. Although there are many different activation
functions, RelU is the most commonly used one in various types
of neural networks due to its ease of training and superior per-
formance due to its linear behavior [96].
