where W represents a planning system composed of spe-
cialized, coordinated agents. Similar to a compiler gen-
erator producing compilers from speciﬁcations, MP con-
structs agent networks from task requirements. It analyzes
objectives, identiﬁes required roles and dependencies, se-
lects appropriate agents, and establishes interaction pro-
tocols. This produces a workﬂow template that deﬁnes
the planning state space and the coordination mechanisms
needed to solve the task.
