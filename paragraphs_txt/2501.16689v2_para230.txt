iment uses the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) to
validate MP’s optimization capabilities. The second in-
volves the Thanksgiving Dinner Planning problem, show-
casing MP’s ability to handle complex, real-world chal-
lenges with cross-thread dependencies and dynamic adapt-
ability. Due to space constraints, detailed results for these
experiments are provided in Appendices D and E, respec-
tively.
