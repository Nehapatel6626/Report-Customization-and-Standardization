SUAVE consists of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) used for underwater pipeline inspection.
The AUVâ€™s mission consists of performing the following actions in sequence: (A1) searching for the
pipeline and (A2) simultaneously following and inspecting the pipeline. When performing its mission, the
AUV is subject to two uncertainties: (U1) thruster failures, and (U2) changes in water visibility. These
uncertainties are triggers for parameter and structural adaptation. When U1 occurs while performing A1 or
A2, the AUV activates a functionality to recover its thrusters. When U2 happens while performing A1, the
AUV adapts its search altitude.
