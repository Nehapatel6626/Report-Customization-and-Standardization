The drawback of attention-based approaches is the low pre-
cision in selecting the attention area, as mentioned in some arti-
cles. Most attention-based methods choose regions of the same
size and shape without considering the image contents. De-
termining the best number of area recommendations involves a
trade-off between small and huge amounts of detail. Another is-
sue is the single-stage structure of attention-based approaches.
Since most approaches have a single encoder-decoder attention
structure, they cannot generate detailed captions for the images
[7]. In a typical attention-based paradigm, an adaptive atten-
tion module learns how often to attend, while a base attention
model performs a single attention step for each time step. In
these methods, the characteristic of the image matches one cap-
tioning word at each time step. As the output of one atten-
tion mechanism depends directly on the outcome of another,
the relationship between the attended feature and the attention
inquiry is not modeled [24].
