In this scenario, a UAV has to search for samples in a predefined area and analyze them. To accomplish
this mission, the UAV can perform the actions (A1) search for samples, (A2) pick up and analyze samples,
(A3) analyze samples on site, (A4) return to base and recharge, and (A5) land and fold gripper. The analyze
action A2 performs a better analysis than A3, however, it consumes more battery. Furthermore, action A2
requires a gripper, while A3 requires an infra-red camera. When operating, the UAV might run out of
battery, and its gripper might fail.
