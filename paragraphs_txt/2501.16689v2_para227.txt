The ﬁnal workﬂow W∗ must be executed in a runtime envi-
ronment. In this work, we evaluate W∗ by entering it into
an LLM (e.g., GPT4o) alongside the problem statement. A
key limitation is that the feedback loop for reﬁning W∗
is currently manual, requiring iterative adjustments to opti-
mize execution. Future research will focus on automating
this process to enhance adaptability and efﬁciency.
