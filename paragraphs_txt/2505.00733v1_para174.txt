search
The
path node component can be
configured with different search
altitudes. Each search altitude
is
distinct
Component Parameter
The search pipeline action requires
control motion, maintain
the
motion,
detect
localization,
pipeline, generate search path, and
coordinate mission functions
The generate search path function
can have multiple function
designs, e.g., one using the
generate spiral search path node
component, and another one using
the generate lawnmower search
path node component
The generate spiral search path
node component can be configured
in different ways by combining
different values of
search
altitude
and speed parameters.
Each combination is represented
as an instance of a component
configuration
