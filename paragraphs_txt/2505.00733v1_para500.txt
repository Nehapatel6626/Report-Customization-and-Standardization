To add structural adaptation to the base scenario (given Assumption 2), it is necessary to add the elements
depicted in Figure 10b to the model. This results in a minimum overhead of 6 elements for each structural
adaptation. To add parameter adaptation to the base scenario (given Assumption 2), it is necessary to add
the elements depicted in Figure 10c to the model. This results in a minimum overhead of 3 elements for
each parameter adaptation.
