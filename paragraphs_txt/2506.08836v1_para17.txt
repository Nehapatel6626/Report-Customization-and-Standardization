Therefore, transcribing Swiss German is conventionally done in Standard Ger-
man, which is considered a translation task rather than a mere transcription.
This translation comes with the corresponding difficulties, e.g., due to spelling
ambiguities or only partly matching vocabularies [16]. Phonetic, morphological,
and syntactic variations across Swiss German dialects and even within the same
dialect further complicate the transcription task.
