The creation of image captions or descriptions can be ap-
proached in various ways. Common architectures such as CNN,
RNN, and LSTM are often used to generate image captions. A
convolutional neural network (CNN), an artificial intelligence
(AI) network, has been utilized in many fields, including pattern
recognition and natural language processing. Artificial neural
networks (ANNs) are mathematical models with layers typi-
cally consisting of an input layer, an output layer, and one or
more hidden layers. If x represents the input and f is the ac-
tivation function, mathematically, a neuron can be represented
as
