Preliminary Testing: In a small pilot study with 100 users, we observed ~30% fewer conversation misalignments 
(e.g., users having to restate or correct context) compared to a baseline chatbot approach. Future larger-scale tests 
could quantify improvements in user satisfaction and task completion time more rigorously.
