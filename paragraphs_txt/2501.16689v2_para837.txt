Upon closer examination of the number of iterations re-
quired to produce a feasible plan, DeepSeek and Claude
each required one revision (two iterations), while GPT4o
required two revisions (three iterations).
In terms of
scheduling quality, measured by slack time, total driving
distance, and load balance, DeepSeek (Table 12) outper-
formed both Claude (Table 14) and GPT4o (Table 13).
DeepSeek optimized time and effort by scheduling James
to wait at the airport for 30 minutes to pick up Emily. In
contrast, Claude scheduled James to drive home and then
return to the airport to pick up Emily, resulting in unnec-
essary travel. GPT4o assigned James to return home and
scheduled Michael to ﬁrst pick up Emily and then proceed
to pick up Grandma, leading to a less balanced load. A
better solution to reduce travel time would have been to
schedule Michael to pick up Emily ﬁrst and then drive with
her to Grandma’s home to pick up Grandma, allowing all
three to return home together. This adjustment would save
30 minutes of driving time and improve Grandma’s overall
happiness to see both grandchildren.
