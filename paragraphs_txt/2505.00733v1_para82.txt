Valner et al. (2022) proposed the TeMoto as a general solution for robotic systems’ dynamic task
and resource management. TeMoto partially solves TACA, as it can adapt the robot’s architecture to
realize the actions being performed by the robot. TeMoto does not completely fulfill TACA as it cannot
adapt the task execution given the robot’s architectural state. TeMoto provides reusable mechanisms for
resource management, but reusability is limited since the adaptation logic must be implemented for all
managed resources, and the knowledge about the dependencies between actions and architecture are
programmatically included in the actions’ code.
