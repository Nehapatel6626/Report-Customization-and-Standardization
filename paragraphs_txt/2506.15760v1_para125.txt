The transforms on a single qubit [16] are done by recursively applying a Hadamard trans- 
n 
n 
form followed by rotations on condition ai, here e(0.ak akâˆ’1 ...a ) = eak/2
. Note that eak/2
is a series of phase operations (ration along the z axis). Each time, the rotation angle re- 
duces by half with an incremental increase of k.
