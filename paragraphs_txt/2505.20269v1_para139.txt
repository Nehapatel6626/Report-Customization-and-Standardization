In this section, we present an adaptation of the encoding proposed by
Tjeng et al. [17] for logic-based explainability. In such a work, the authors
originally used the encoding to find adversarial examples without using logical
implications. Even more importantly, such an encoding uses fewer variables and
constraints compared to [5]. Then, we expect that our adaptation can lead to
a better execution time for both building the logical constraints and computing
explanations. Adapting the encoding in [17] to the context of computing
explanations requires incorporating additional constraints that were not part
of the original work. These new constraints represent the class predicted by the
ANN as a formula E, as seen in Section 3. However, to maintain the concept of
the original encoding without implications, we define these additional constraints
without implications.
