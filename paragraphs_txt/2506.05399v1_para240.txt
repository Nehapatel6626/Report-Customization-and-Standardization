The human visual system inspires the mechanism of atten-
tion in image processing. Like our eyes do not take in every de-
tail of an image at once, the attention mechanism also focuses
on the key elements before moving on to the next. This ap-
proach is believed to enhance image captioning by eliminating
irrelevant information. By mimicking the cognitive function of
human vision, this mechanism can also reduce computational
load and improve training accuracy [38].
