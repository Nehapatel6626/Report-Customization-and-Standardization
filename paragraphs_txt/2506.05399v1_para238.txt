People can focus on certain details while disregarding oth-
ers when receiving information. This self-selection process is
known as attention. The attention mechanism is an important
development in generation-based models within the encoder-
decoder architecture. It aims to improve the encoder-decoder
model by imitating the human eyeâ€™s focus on different areas in
an image when generating descriptive words. The concept of
attention originated from studying human vision in cognitive
neurology, which led to the discovery of this higher brain func-
tion. The attention mechanism has diverse applications, includ-
ing image categorization in visual images and various experi-
ments in natural language processing, such as machine trans-
lation, abstract creation, text understanding, text classification,
and visual captioning [52].
