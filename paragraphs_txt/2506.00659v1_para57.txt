Requirement 2 - Efficient Packer Integration. It must efficiently integrate
packers using a limited number of real-world samples, addressing challenges such
as inaccessible packers and variations within a single packer family. It should
rapidly update its identification capabilities without requiring extensive or fre-
quent retraining. To achieve this, the system should leverage robust algorithms
