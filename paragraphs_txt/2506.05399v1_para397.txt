Employing saliency is based on how our brain processes
visual information.
It combines a bottom-up flow of visual
inputs with a top-down reasoning process. The top-down ap-
proach involves predicting incoming information from the en-
vironment using our prior knowledge and logical bias. In con-
trast, the bottom-up approach involves visual signals that cor-
rect the prior predictions. Additive attention can be approached
as a top-down system, where the language model observes a
feature grid independent of the image content and predicts the
subsequent word. The bottom-up path is defined by an object
detector responsible for identifying image regions. Then, a top-
down process learns to weigh each region for each word predic-
tion. This approach is connected with the concept of additive
attention [25].
