We implemented generation of two different types of mnemonics, both using the same algorithm.  The first one was for memorizing numbers, where each individual digit is encoded in the length of words of an utterance, with zero coded for by any word longer than nine characters. For instance the speed of light, 299,792,458 m/s, can be encoded as ‘He certainly presented himself incapable of such cruel behavior’ (this particular example was generated using the Jane Austen training corpus).
