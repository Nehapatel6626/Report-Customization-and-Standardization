The corpus was created to reflect diversity, aiming to include all dialect re-
gions, while ensuring a balanced gender ratio. However, children and individuals
over 65 might be significantly underrepresented, as most speakers are broadcast
presenters, likely in their professional years. Thus, older individuals, as well as
younger ones, are primarily represented in conversational contexts (ref. Table 8).
As a result, models trained on this dataset may perform below average for these
demographic groups and individuals with strong, less commonly spoken dialects.
