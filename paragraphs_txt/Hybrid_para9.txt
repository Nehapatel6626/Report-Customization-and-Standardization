A novel approach that is a hybrid between the naïve Bayes approach and the decision tree method is presented.  The hybrid approach produces a spectrum of options that could be used for learning by merely changing parameter values. At one end lies the naïve Bayes approach, while at the other lies the decision tree technique. The proposed hybrid scheme solves the problem of poor naïve Bayes performance in a domain with dependent attributes, and the memory consumption problem of the decision tree.  We analyze this idea and show encouraging experimental data that backs the need for such a solution.
