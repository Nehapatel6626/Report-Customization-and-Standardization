The performance of the FDRL framework is evaluated
based on Surgical Precision, which is measured via incision
accuracy, tool placement, and minimal tissue damage, as well
as Training Efficiency, which assesses convergence time and
computational resource utilization. Adaptability is evaluated
through the policy switching rate in response to dynamic
patient conditions, expressed as
