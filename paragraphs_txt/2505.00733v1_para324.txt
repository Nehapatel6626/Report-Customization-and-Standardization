Planning: To enable task decision-making and execution with PDDL-based planners in combination with
ROSA, the planner and plan executor must consider the runtime feasibility of performing the robot’s actions
as inferred by the KB component. This work maps the action status from ROSA’s knowledge model to
PDDL by capturing whether the action’s status is feasible as a PDDL predicate of the form “action feasible
?action” and using it as a precondition to select the respective action. An example can be seen in Listing 4
where the action my action can only be selected when it does not have an ‘unfeasible’ status in the KB.
At runtime, if an action becomes unfeasible during execution, the plan executor triggers re-planning to
generate a new action plan. This results in task execution adaptation and, if the newly selected actions
require a different architectural configuration, also in architectural adaptation, i.e., TACA.
