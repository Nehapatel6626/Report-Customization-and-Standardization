Experimental results from real applications can continuously provide heuristics for the design of distributed object databases (DDODB) that may be incorporated in our analysis algorithm. Indeed, we have tried to manually improve the analysis algorithm using experimental results from [23, 25], which required a detailed analysis of each result and manual modifications on the analysis algorithm. However, the formalization of new heuristics from these experiments and their incorporation in the analysis algorithm, while maintaining previous heuristics consistent, proved to be an increasingly difficult task.
