What is Artificial Intelligence(John McCarthy , Basic Questions)

What is artificial intelligence? 
It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable. 

Yes, but what is intelligence? 
Intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world. Varying kinds and degrees of intelligence occur in people, many animals and some machines. 

Isn't there a solid definition of intelligence that doesn't depend on relating it to human intelligence? 
Not yet. The problem is that we cannot yet characterize in general what kinds of computational procedures we want to call intelligent. We understand some of the mechanisms of intelligence and not others.

What is AI?
Views of AI fall into four categories:


	Thinking humanly	Thinking rationally 
	Acting humanly	Acting rationally 

The textbook advocates "acting rationally“
List of AI-topics

What  is Artificial Intelligence?

Human-like (“How to simulate humans intellect and behavior on by a machine.)
Mathematical problems (puzzles, games, theorems)
Common-sense reasoning (if there is parking-space, probably illegal to park)
Expert knowledge: lawyers, medicine, diagnosis
Social behavior
Rational-like: 
achieve goals, have performance measure

The Birthplace of “Artificial Intelligence”, 1956
Darmouth workshop, 1956: historical meeting of the precieved founders of AI met: John McCarthy,  Marvin Minsky, Alan Newell,   and Herbert Simon.

A Proposal for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence. J. McCarthy, M. L. Minsky, N. Rochester, and C.E. Shannon. August 31, 1955. "We propose that a 2 month, 10 man study of artificial intelligence be carried out during the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it." And this marks the debut of the term "artificial intelligence.“

Agent types
271- Fall 2006
Agents
An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators

Human agent: eyes, ears, and other organs for sensors; hands,
legs, mouth, and other body parts for actuators

Robotic agent: cameras and infrared range finders for sensors;
various motors for actuators

271- Fall 2006
Agents and environments



The agent function maps from percept histories to actions:

[f: P*  A]

The agent program runs on the physical architecture to produce f

agent = architecture + program

271- Fall 2006
Vacuum-cleaner world




Percepts: location and contents, e.g., [A,Dirty]

Actions: Left, Right, Suck, NoOp

271- Fall 2006
Rational agents
An agent should strive to "do the right thing", based on what it can perceive and the actions it can perform. The right action is the one that will cause the agent to be most successful

Performance measure: An objective criterion for success of an agent's behavior

E.g., performance measure of a vacuum-cleaner agent could be amount of dirt cleaned up, amount of time taken, amount of electricity consumed, amount of noise generated, etc.

271- Fall 2006
Rational agents
Rational Agent: For each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select an action that is expected to maximize its performance measure, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has.

What’s involved in Intelligence?Intelligent agents
Ability to interact with the real world
to perceive, understand, and act
e.g., speech recognition and understanding and synthesis
e.g., image understanding
e.g., ability to take actions, have an effect
Knowledge Representation, Reasoning and Planning
modeling the external world, given input
solving new problems, planning and making decisions
ability to deal with unexpected problems, uncertainties
Learning and Adaptation
we are continuously learning and adapting
our internal models are always being “updated”
e.g. a baby learning to categorize and recognize animals
271- Fall 2006
Implementing agents
Table look-ups
Autonomy
All actions are completely specified
no need in sensing, no autonomy
example: Monkey and the banana
Structure of an agent
agent = architecture + program

Example: Taxi driver
Simple reflex
If car-in-front-is-breaking then initiate-breaking
Agents that keep track of the world
If car-in-front-is-breaking and on fwy then initiate-breaking
needs internal state
goal-based
If car-in-front-is-breaking and needs to get to hospital then go to adjacent lane and plan
search and planning
utility-based
If car-in-front-is-breaking and on fwy and  needs to get to hospital alive then search of a way to get to the hospital that will make your passengers happy.
Needs utility function that map a state to a real function (am I happy?)
