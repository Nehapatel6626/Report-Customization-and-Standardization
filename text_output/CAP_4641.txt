Catalog Description:

Topics will include the concepts, principles, and approaches of the computer processing of natural languages, including the relevant linguistics phenomena, formal methods, and end applications.

Textbook: “Speech and Language Processing, 2nd Edition” by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin, Pearson Prentice Hall, 2009 (ISBN-13: 978-0-13-187321-6).

References: None

Prerequisites Courses: COP3530 (Data Structures) or equivalent

Corequisites Courses: None





Type:  Elective for the CS Major





Prerequisites Topics:

Familiarity with basic techniques of algorithm analysis

Familiarity with recursive methods

Understand linked data structures (linked lists, binary trees)

Understand advanced data structures (priority queues, disjoint set union/find) 





Course Outcomes:



Explain key linguistic phenomena at the morphological, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic levels of language.



Apply the formal approaches to representing these linguistic phenomena, such as formal models of grammar, HMMs, and frame semantics.



Explain the computational approaches to manipulating these formal representations, including rule-based and statistical classifier approaches.



Outline how existing techniques may be assembled to create end-to-end natural language applications such as question answering or machine translation systems.
