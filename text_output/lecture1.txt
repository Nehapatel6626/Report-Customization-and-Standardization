Why are we talking about cybersecurity?
U.S. National Cybersecurity
Case 1: Internet Under Siege
February 7 - 9, 2000Yahoo!, Amazon, Buy.com, CNN.com, eBay, E*Trade, ZDNet websites hit with massive DOS

Attacks received the attention of president Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno.
 
“A 15-year-old kid could launch these attacks, it doesn’t take a great deal of sophistication to do” – Ron Dick, Director NIPC, February 9

U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials have estimated the attacks caused $1.7 billion in damage

U.S. National Cybersecurity
Case 2: Slammer Worm
January 2003Infects 90% of vulnerable computers within 10 minutes
Effect of the Worm- Interference with elections- Cancelled airline flights- 911 emergency systems affected in Seattle- 13,000 Bank of America ATMs failed
No malicious payload!
Estimated ~$1 Billion in productivity loss

U.S. National Cybersecurity
Case 3: WorldCom
July 2002WorldCom declares bankruptcy
ProblemWorldCom carries 13% - 50% of global internet traffic.  About 40% of Internet traffic uses WorldCom’s network at some point
October 2002Outage affecting only 20% of WorldCom users snarls traffic around the globe
Congressional HearingsCongress considers, but rejects, extension of FCC regulatory powers to prevent WorldCom shutdown

Vulnerabilities are not just technical
U.S. National Cybersecurity
Case 4: September 11
Wireless Tower on Top of Trade Center Destroyed
AT&T has record call volumes
“Flash” usage severely limits availability
Rescue efforts hampered
	
Physical Vulnerability!
Legitimate Usage!
U.S. National Cybersecurity
Case 5: It’s a Jungle Out There
The Internet is highly, globally connected

Viruses/worms are legion on the Internet and continue to scan for vulnerable hosts

Hackers scan looking for easy targets to attack

What’s really going on here
U.S. National Cybersecurity
Increasing Dependence
We are increasingly dependent on the Internet:

Directly
Communication (Email, IM, VoIP)
Commerce (business, banking, e-commerce, etc)
Control systems (public utilities, etc)
Information and entertainment
Sensitive data stored on the Internet

Indirectly
Biz, Edu, Gov have permanently replaced physical/manual processes with Internet-based processes

U.S. National Cybersecurity
Security Not A Priority
Other design priorities often trump security:

Cost
Speed
Convenience
Open Architecture
Backwards Compatibility
U.S. National Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity Roadblocks
No metrics to measure (in)security

Internet is inherently international

Private sector owns most of the infrastructure

“Cybersecurity Gap”: a cost/incentive disconnect?
Businesses will pay to meet business imperatives
Who’s going to pay to meet national security imperatives?
U.S. National Cybersecurity
An Achilles Heel?
This level of dependence makes the Internet a target for asymmetric attack

Cyberwarfare
Cyberterrorism
Cyberhooliganism*


and a weak spot for accidents and failures
* Coined by Bruce Schneier, Counterpane
U.S. National Cybersecurity
The Challenge
A solution to this problem will require both the right technology and the right public policy.


This is the cybersecurity challenge.
U.S. National Cybersecurity

What is “cybersecurity?”
U.S. National Cybersecurity
According to the U.S. Dept of Commerce:

n. cybersecurity:

Some Definitions
n. information security: The protection of information against unauthorized disclosure, transfer, modification, or destruction, whether accidental or intentional. 



See “information security”
U.S. National Cybersecurity
Some Definitions
According to H.R. 4246 “Cyber Security Information Act”:

cybersecurity: “The vulnerability of any computing system, software program, or critical infrastructure to, or their ability to resist, intentional interference, compromise, or incapacitation through the misuse of, or by unauthorized means of, the Internet, public or private telecommunications systems or other similar conduct that violates Federal, State, or international law, that harms interstate commerce of the United States, or that threatens public health or safety.”
U.S. National Cybersecurity
Some Definitions
According to S. 1901 “Cybersecurity Research and Education Act of 2002”:

cybersecurity: “information assurance, including scientific, technical, management, or any other relevant disciplines required to ensure computer and network security, including, but not limited to, a discipline related to the following functions:

(A) Secure System and network administration and operations.
(B) Systems security engineering.
(C) Information assurance systems and product acquisition.
(D) Cryptography.
(E) Threat and vulnerability assessment, including risk management.
(F) Web security.
(G) Operations of computer emergency response teams.
(H) Cybersecurity training, education, and management.
(I) Computer forensics.
(J) Defensive information operations.
U.S. National Cybersecurity
Some Definitions
According to S. 1900 “Cyberterrorism Preparedness Act of 2002 ”:

cybersecurity: “information assurance, including information security, information technology disaster recovery, and information privacy.”

In Context
corporate cybersecurity = availability, integrity and secrecy of information systems and networks in the face of attacks, accidents and failures with the goal of protecting a corporation’s operations and assets 

national cybersecurity = availability, integrity and secrecy of the information systems and networks in the face of attacks, accidents and failures with the goal of protecting a nation’s operations and assets 
U.S. National Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity as a Discipline
How to achieve cybersecurity “success”?
How to overcome the cybersecurity problem?

Must understand four factors that play into the cybersecurity equation:

Technology
Economics (of stakeholders and incentives)
Social Influences (e.g. Big Brother fears) 
Public Policy

U.S. National Cybersecurity

What This Class is All About
U.S. National Cybersecurity
Goal of the Class

 Build a foundation of knowledge

 Explore salient advanced topics

 Prepare students to critically analyze interdisciplinary questions relating to the cybersecurity challenge   


U.S. National Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity Questions
How vulnerable is the United States to a cyberattack? Are we heading for an “electronic pearl harbor”?

What areas of vulnerability require the greatest attention in order to improve our national cybersecurity? 

With what parties must the government work in order to make significant cybersecurity improvements?

Are market forces sufficient to provide for US national cybersecurity? Should the government get involved to change these forces, and if so, how?
U.S. National Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity Questions

Is the Internet an appropriate platform upon which to operate infrastructure systems critical to US economic or government operation?  

What characteristics would we want in an “Ideal Internet”?  

Can the current Internet evolve into a network with significantly improved security guarantees or will another system need to created?

Does greater Internet security necessarily entail decreased online privacy?

U.S. National Cybersecurity
How We Will Get There
Use intro lectures provide a technical and policy foundation.  

Develop a framework within which to think about and discussion cybersecurity. 

Learn from expert guest lecturers and weekly readings that provide in-depth perspectives on advanced topics.

Challenge classmates, student leaders, and expert guests during in-class discussions and activities.

Our Evaluation



The Cybersecurity Legislative Debate

Write a well-reasoned analysis a piece of cybersecurity legislation and provide a voting recommendation.

2) 	In groups, create an in-class presentation backing a single position on one of the bills.  You will debate an opposing group and your will defend your stance against questioning from the rival group and the class at large.

3)  Both the class and a panel of celebrity judges will vote on the winner of each debate.

The Internet is Hard to Secure
Extreme complexity, minimal understanding

High global connectivity

Weak attribution (who’s doing what?)

Hard to tell malicious uses from legitimate ones
