Dear Sir/Madam,
This power point presentation on Research 
proposal  will be an excellent resource for 
students  doing research . 
              My best wishes

Research refers to a search for knowledge
Research means  a scientific and systematic search for pertinent information on a specific topic
In fact, research is an art of scientific investigation.
The purpose of research is to discover answers to questions through the application of scientific procedures
Type of Research study
To gain familiarity with a phenomenon or to achieve new insights into it (Exploratory or formulative research studies
To describe accurately the characteristics of a particular individual, situation or a group (Descriptive research studies)
To determine the frequency with which something occurs or with which it is associated with something else (Diagnostic research studies)
To test a hypothesis of a causal relationship between variables (Hypothesis-testing research studies).

Descriptive research includes surveys and fact-finding
 enquiries. The main characteristic of this method is that 
the researcher has no control over the variables; he can 
only report what has happened or what is happening
In analytical research, on the other hand, the researcher has to 
use facts or information already available, and analyze these to make
 a critical evaluation of the material.
Applied research aims at finding a solution for an 
immediate problem facing a society or an industrial/business 
organisation
“Gathering knowledge for knowledge’s sake is termed ‘pure’ or 
‘basic’ research.”
Attitude or opinion research i.e., research designed to find out how people feel or what they think about a particular subject or institution is also qualitative research
 Empirical research  is data-based research, experimental type of research. Such research is thus characterised by the experimenter’s control over the variables under study and his deliberate manipulation of one of them to study its effects
One-time research or longitudinal research
Field-setting research or laboratory research or
Simulation research
Clinical or diagnostic research
Historical research
Conclusion-oriented 
and decision-oriented
RESEARCH PROPOSAL
Any Medical research / Epidemiological 
study should have a proper proposal in 
written form before it is actually carried 
out
It is like a blue print of a building plan 
before the construction starts 
Writing a research proposal is both 
science and art
A good research proposal is based on scientific facts and on the art of clear communication 
  Writing a formal research proposal should 
be started  by the  time one has  decided on 
the topic  for the study

Objectives
This is a very important and pivotal section
 and everything else in the study is centered
 around it
The objective of the proposed study should
 be stated very clearly 
The objective stated should be  specific, achievable and measurable
Too many objectives to be avoided
Even just one clearly stated relevant objective for a study would be good enough 
If there is more than one objective the objectives can be presented in  the appropriate order of importance 

Introduction
The problem proposed to be studied 
is introduced in this section 
It should help the reader to acquaint 
with the topic 



Introduction should be short about one 
or two pages 
The problem should be stated in such a 
way that it’s importance and relevance 
is realized by any one who reads it 
Background(Review of Literature)
This section reflects extensive review of literature done by the investigator 
In this section what is already known about the topic is written including the lacunae
Just quoting the literature verbatim will not serve the purpose 
It is important to make it coherent, relevant and easily readable knowledge 
It helps the investigator to gain good knowledge in that field of inquiry
It also helps the investigator to have insight on different methodologies that  could be applied




Research methodology
     Research methodology is a way to 
systematically solve the research problem. It 
may be understood as a science of studying 
how research is done scientifically
It is necessary for the researcher to know not only the research methods/techniques but also the methodology. 
Researchers not only need to know how to develop certain indices or tests and how to calculate the mean, the mode, the median or the standard deviation or chi-square etc.,
It is essential to discuss procedures clearly
 and completely with  considerable amount
 of details 
Study design
Study population / Sampling specifications
Sample size needed 
Instrumentation
Specific procedures 
Study design
Definition:  A study design is a specific plan
 or  protocol for conducting the study, which 
allows the investigator to translate the 
conceptual hypothesis into an operational 
one.
The study design should be clearly
 stated
The study design to be used should be
appropriate for achieving the objective 
of the study 
Study population / Sample specifications 
It is important to describe which would be 
the study population 
How study subjects would be selected, 
randomization process and other details 
should be given 
Sample size
 It is important to mention in the protocol what
 would be the minimum  sample required and how
 it is  arrived 
     Determination of sample size is a
 bargain between precision and the  
price (Resources & expenses involved)

Description of process 
Proposal should include the details of all process
to be adopted in the study
How exposures, outcome variables and other 
variables are going to be measured  should be described in
detail 
A brief description of how the data will be processed 
and use of statistical package if any should be given
What statistical tests of significance   would be used?


Time Frame & Work Schedule 
    The proposal should include the sequence of
tasks to be performed, the anticipated length
of time required for its completion and the 
personnel required 
It can be presented in tabular or graphic form (Gantt chart)
Flow charts and other diagrams are often
 useful for highlighting the sequencing and
 interrelationship of different activities in the 
study 
Facilities
The proposal should also include the
 important facilities required / available 
for the study namely computers, laboratories, special equipment etc 
Personnel
Proposal should include who are the primary  investigators and co- investigators, their  qualifications, research experience etc 
The proposal may also include the Major
 roles to be taken up by different investigators 
Budget
The budget translates project activities 
into monetary terms
It is a statement of how much money  will
 be  required to accomplish the  various tasks 
Budget
Major items
Salary for staff
Travel
Purchase of equipment
Printing / Xeroxing
Consultancy charges
Institutional overheads
