EXAMINATIONS (60%)

There will be THREE examinations. Please see the schedule below for the dates and times of each examination. Exams are multiple choice. Exam questions will cover both text and class material. There will be material on the exam not discussed in the text (i.e. case discussions, videos, and class activities), so it is imperative that you come to class. Exams are not cumulative.

THERE WILL BE NO MAKE UP EXAMS unless you have a written university excused absence or written documentation from a doctor. If you have an excused absence, you will have 7 days to make up the material.



HOMEWORK & QUIZZES (10%)

I will assign points based on completion of homework assignments and involvement during class activities/discussion. You will be asked to complete numerous homework assignments during the semester and turn them in during class. Your completion of these assignments will, in large part, determine this component of your grade. However, your grade will also consist of quizzes during class that assess your  knowledge of class discussion material and assignments.



ATTENDANCE (10%)

I will take attendance on 20 random days during the semester at the beginning or end of class (likely on presentation days). If you are not in your seat then, you will be marked absent. If you have other commitments that may prevent you from being on time, please discuss them with me. If you leave the class before the class ends, you will be marked absent. Because much of your learning (and my assessment of your learning) is based on class discussions and activities, it is imperative that you attend class and participate in class discussions and activities. 



FORTUNE 200 CEO PRESENTATION (20%)

In groups of 2-3, you will choose a company from the 2012 Fortune 200 list:  http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2012/full_list/  You need to prepare a report and visual presentation that includes: 1) background on the company; 2) bio on the CEO; and 3) analysis of leadership at the company and leadership of CEO in particular. You need to complete a report (5 page maximum) including the above, as well as a 15 minute presentation. These will be due and presented the last few weeks of the semester.



CELL PHONES & LAPTOPS

Your cell phones must be silenced during class.  Laptops are permitted in class for note taking purposes only, and are not necessary during case presentations.  Emailing, instant messaging, texting, and internet surfing are strictly prohibited. Because these activities are distracting and disrespectful to your classmates and your professor, I reserve the right to approach you in class without notification and warning, and to see what else you have opened on your laptop.  If there is anything other than Blackboard, PowerPoint, or Word open along your toolbar, you will be asked to leave the room. 

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

All students enrolled in this course are expected to adhere to the UT Arlington Honor Code:

“I pledge, on my honor, to uphold UT Arlington’s tradition of academic integrity, a tradition that values hard work and honest effort in the pursuit of academic excellence. I promise that I will submit only work that I personally create or contribute to group collaborations, and I will appropriately reference any work from other sources. I will follow the highest standards of integrity and uphold the spirit of the Honor Code.”

Instructors may employ the Honor Code as they see fit in their courses, including (but not limited to) having students acknowledge the honor code as part of an examination or requiring students to incorporate the honor code into any work submitted. Per UT System Regents’ Rule 50101, §2.2, suspected violations of university’s standards for academic integrity (including the Honor Code) will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct. Violators will be disciplined in accordance with University policy, which may result in the student’s suspension or expulsion from the University.



STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES

	The University of Texas at Arlington is on record as being committed to both the spirit and letter of all federal equal opportunity legislation, including the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). All instructors at UT Arlington are required by law to provide "reasonable accommodations" to students with disabilities, so as not to discriminate on the basis of that disability. Any student requiring an accommodation for this course must provide the instructor with official documentation in the form of a letter certified by the staff in the Office for Students with Disabilities, University Hall 102. Only those students who have officially documented a need for an accommodation will have their request honored. Information regarding diagnostic criteria and policies for obtaining disability-based academic accommodations can be found at www.uta.edu/disability or by calling the Office for Students with Disabilities at (817) 272-3364.

	

STUDENT FEEDBACK SURVEY

																													At the end of each term, students enrolled in classes categorized as lecture, seminar, or laboratory shall be directed to complete a Student Feedback Survey (SFS). Instructions on how to access the SFS for this course will be sent directly to each student through MavMail approximately 10 days before the end of the term. Each student’s feedback enters the SFS database anonymously and is aggregated with that of other students enrolled in the course. UT Arlington’s effort to solicit, gather, tabulate, and publish student feedback is required by state law; students are strongly urged to participate. For more information, visit http://www.uta.edu/sfs. 

																													

FINAL REVIEW WEEK

																													A period of five class days prior to the first day of final examinations in the long sessions shall be designated as Final Review Week. The purpose of this week is to allow students sufficient time to prepare for final examinations. During this week, there shall be no scheduled activities such as required field trips or performances; and no instructor shall assign any themes, research problems or exercises of similar scope that have a completion date during or following this week unless specified in the class syllabus. During Final Review Week, an instructor shall not give any examinations constituting 10% or more of the final grade, except makeup tests and laboratory examinations. In addition, no instructor shall give any portion of the final examination during Final Review Week. During this week, classes are held as scheduled. In addition, instructors are not required to limit content to topics that have been previously covered; they may introduce new concepts as appropriate.

																													

DROP POLICY

Students may drop or swap (adding and dropping a class concurrently) classes through self-service in MyMav from the beginning of the registration period through the late registration period. After the late registration period, students must see their academic advisor to drop a class or withdraw. Undeclared students must see an advisor in the University Advising Center. Drops can continue through a point two-thirds of the way through the term or session. It is the student's responsibility to officially withdraw if they do not plan to attend after registering. Students will not be automatically dropped for non-attendance. Repayment of certain types of financial aid administered through the University may be required as the result of dropping classes or withdrawing. For more information, contact the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships (http://wweb.uta.edu/ses/fao).



STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES

	UT Arlington provides a variety of resources and programs designed to help students develop academic skills, deal with personal situations, and better understand concepts and information related to their courses. Resources include tutoring, major-based learning centers, developmental education, advising and mentoring, personal counseling, and federally funded programs. For individualized referrals, students may visit the reception desk at University College (Ransom Hall), call the Maverick Resource Hotline at 817-272-6107, send a message to resources@uta.edu, or view the information at www.uta.edu/resources.

	

ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION (UTA E-MAIL)

	UT Arlington has adopted MavMail as its official means to communicate with students about important deadlines and events, as well as to transact university-related business regarding financial aid, tuition, grades, graduation, etc. All students are assigned a MavMail account and are responsible for checking the inbox regularly. There is no additional charge to students for using this account, which remains active even after graduation. Information about activating and using MavMail is available at http://www.uta.edu/oit/cs/email/mavmail.php.
