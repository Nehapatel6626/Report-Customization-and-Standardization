Spatial Analysis and Spatial Statistics for Research in GIS, Geography and Land Management

Special Lecture Series at Henan University, May  and September 2012

Dr. Ron Briggs

Professor Emeritus

The University of Texas at Dallas



Goals for Students

Improve your research by explaining standard research practices and procedures in western countries

Expand your understanding of English by talking in English about some GIS concepts you already know, and some that you don’t

Enhance your understanding of Spatial Analysis in general, and Spatial Statistics in particular

Provide exposure to U.S. data and associated geographical concepts (State Plane Coordinate System, Metropolitan Statistical Areas, census tracts, etc.)



Week 1 (May 7)

1. Research Methodology: The Central Role of Goals and Objectives.  (1Intro.ppt: 37 slides)  

2. Spatial Analysis: Concepts and Issues    (2spatanal.ppt: 42 slides) 

3. Spatial Data:  What is special about spatial data?   (3spatdata.ppt: 33 slides)
