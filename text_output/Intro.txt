Options for In Class Labs
10 workstations in 0222
Too few to allow for a good in class lab experience
Will try to supplement with some additional VMs
Want to identify a secondary time to allow for class labs to be run twice.
Before or after normal class time?
Some time on MWF?

Class Non-Goal
Class will not make you expert in any particular security technology
If that is your goal, better to take a specific technology training course or self study
