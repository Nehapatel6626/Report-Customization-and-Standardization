Abstract: Are AI systems truly representing human values, or merely averaging across them?
Our study suggests a concerning reality: Large Language Models (LLMs) fail to represent diverse
cultural moral frameworks despite their linguistic capabilities. We expose significant gaps between
AI-generated and human moral intuitions by applying the Moral Foundations Questionnaire across 19
cultural contexts. Comparing multiple state-of-the-art LLMs’ origins against human baseline data,
we find these models systematically homogenize moral diversity. Surprisingly, increased model size
doesn’t consistently improve cultural representation fidelity. Our findings challenge the growing use
of LLMs as synthetic populations in social science research and highlight a fundamental limitation in
current AI alignment approaches. Without data-driven alignment beyond prompting, these systems
cannot capture the nuanced, culturally-specific moral intuitions. Our results call for more grounded
alignment objectives and evaluation metrics to ensure AI systems represent diverse human values
rather than flattening the moral landscape.

Introduction

AI alignment represents the congruence between artificial systems’ behaviors and human
values, expectations, and intentions. In the context of Large Language Models (LLMs),
alignment takes on a complex dimension as these systems attempt to replicate human-
like responses across diverse moral and ethical frameworks [shen2024towards]. True
alignment demands that AI systems not only produce outputs that superficially resemble
human responses but also demonstrate consistent understanding of the underlying moral
foundations that guide human decision-making across different cultural contexts. The concept
of alignment extends beyond mere technical performance to encompass moral and cultural
dimensions. While technical alignment ensures functionality within specified parameters,
moral alignment requires AI systems to represent and reason within ethical frameworks that
humans find acceptable across diverse cultural backgrounds. This multifaceted approach to
understanding AI alignment presents a sociotechnical challenge requiring interdisciplinary
solutions [cabrera2023ethical].

Our study addresses a critical question in AI alignment research: Are LLMs truly representing
diverse human values, or merely averaging across them? This question becomes particularly
significant when considering the application of LLMs as synthetic populations in social
science research—a growing trend that assumes these models can accurately represent human
response distributions across different demographic and cultural groups. Recent studies
have highlighted inconsistencies in LLM alignment, particularly regarding ideological
and moral representations. Prior research [munker2024towards] demonstrates that in-
context prompting alone fails to consistently align model-generated responses with human
ideological distributions. High response variance across multiple repetitions suggests that
current LLMs do not robustly encode stable moral perspectives, further complicating efforts
for reliable AI alignment.

Building on this foundation, our research systematically evaluates how LLMs represent
diverse cultural moral frameworks by applying the Moral Foundations Questionnaire
(MFQ-2) [atari2023morality] across 19 cultural contexts. By comparing multiple state-
of-the-art LLMs against human baseline data, we investigate whether these models can
faithfully represent the nuanced, culturally-specific moral intuitions that characterize human
moral reasoning. Our findings challenge assumptions about LLMs’ capabilities for cultural
representation and highlight fundamental limitations in current AI alignment approaches.

2 Background

We aim to connect our work to the existing critique of LLMs, with a focus on their application
and the perception of their capabilities in terms of language understanding and ability to
communicate. Further, we outline the unreflected application of synthetic users in the social
sciences as human replacements and critique the expressiveness of those studies.

2.1 Not more than stochastic parrots?

bender2021dangers critiqued that language models only manipulated textual content
statistically to generate responses that give the impression of language understanding, like a
parrot that listens to a myriad of conversations and anticipates how to react accordingly.
Current conversational models are published by commercial facilities, with a business
model relying on the illusion of models capable of language understanding and human-like
conversation skills [kanbach2024genai]. The epistemological debate surrounding LLMs
centers on two extreme standpoints: a reductionist perspective that considers these models as
next-word prediction machines based on matrix multiplication and an anthropomorphic view
that attributes human-like qualities to those systems [bubeck2023sparks]. This dichotomy
reveals the fundamental challenge in interpreting artificial intelligence: distinguishing
between computational mimicry and genuine understanding.

While we disagree with a (naive) anthropomorphism and current research questions the
language understanding capabilities [dziri2023faith], we argue that when utilizing LLMs
as human simulacra [shanahan2024simulacra], we must assume human-like qualities
to a certain degree. This methodological approach is not an endorsement of sentience,
but a pragmatic necessity for meaningful simulation. Without this assumption, utilizing
LLM agents to model interpersonal communication can only yield a shallow copy, a
conversation between parroting entities devoid of meaningful interaction. The limitations
of current language models become particularly evident when examining their inability to
truly comprehend context beyond statistical patterns. Unlike human communication, which
is deeply rooted in embodied experience, emotional intelligence, and contextual nuance,
LLMs operate through probabilistic text generation. They lack the fundamental cognitive
processes that enable humans to interpret subtext, understand implicit meaning, and engage
in genuine empathetic communication.

2.2 LLMs as synthetic characters

The usage of LLMs as human simulacra (representation) began with the application
as non-player characters (NPCs) in a Sims-style game world to simulate interpersonal
communication and day-to-day lives [park2023generative]. The application of LLMs as
synthetic characters has expanded beyond gaming environments into various fields of social
science research [argyle2023out]. These disciplines have increasingly adopted these models
as replacements in social studies, arguing that conditioning through prompting causes the
systems to accurately emulate response distributions from a variety of human subgroups
[argyle2023out]. This approach represents a paradigm shift in research methodology,
promising unprecedented scalability and diversity in social science investigations. However,
this methodological innovation comes with profound methodological and ethical challenges.
Current research raises critical concerns about several fundamental issues:

Representational Bias Existing studies have demonstrated persistent biases in training
data leading to misrepresentation of certain groups or viewpoints [abid2021persistent;
hutchinson2020social]. These biases are not merely superficial but deeply embedded in
the model’s generative processes, potentially perpetuating and amplifying existing social
inequities.

Epistemological Limitations Without a deeper understanding of the model’s repre-
sentations of ideologies, researchers risk oversimplifying complex human behaviors and
social dynamics. The models provide an illusion of comprehensiveness while funda-
mentally lacking the nuanced understanding that emerges from lived human experience
[shanahan2024simulacra].

Embodiment Deficit Most critically, these approaches [argyle2023out] ignore that
LLMs lack embodiment in the physical world. This disembodied nature means they
lack the grounding in physical reality – expressed through cultural contexts, physical
environments, and interpersonal relationships – that shapes human cognition, perception,
and decision-making [hussein2012sapir].

The concept of embodied cognition becomes paramount in understanding these limitations.
Human understanding is not merely a computational process but a deeply integrated experi-
ence that involves sensory perception, emotional processing, and contextual interpretation.
LLMs, by contrast, operate through abstract mathematical representations that fundamentally
disconnect language from lived experience. As researchers, we must approach LLM-based
synthetic characters with a critical lens, recognizing them as sophisticated simulation tools
rather than genuine human proxies. The promise of these technologies lies not in their ability
to replace human subjects, but in their potential to augment and expand our understanding
of complex social phenomena.

3 Methods

Our research investigates how consistently LLMs represent diverse moral frameworks
without specialized fine-tuning. We extend previous research [munker2024towards] that
examined political bias in LLMs through the lens of the Moral Foundation Theory
(MFQ) [graham2009liberals] by applying the updated Moral Foundations Questionnaire
Version (MFQ-2) [atari2023morality] across cross-cultural contexts rather than political
ideologies. The MFQ-2 expands upon the original questionnaire by providing a more
nuanced measurement of moral intuitions across dimensions. Thus, the updated version
allows for a more comprehensive assessment across different cultural contexts.

3.1 Moral Foundation Questionnaire 2023 (MFQ-2)

We systematically investigate the moral foundations of LLMs through repeated adminis-
trations of the MFQ-2 [atari2023morality]. To ensure statistical robustness and capture
the nuanced variability of model responses, we generate synthetic populations consisting
of 50 independent samples for each unique model-culture combination. The MFQ-2, a
well-established psychometric instrument, comprises 36 items that comprehensively map
onto six foundational moral dimensions: care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal,
authority/subversion, sanctity/degradation, and liberty/oppression [atari2023morality].
Participants — in our case, LLMs — respond to each item using a standardized 5-point
Likert scale ranging from 1 ("Does not describe me at all") to 5 ("describes me extremely
well"). This methodological approach allows quantitatively assessing the moral reasoning
tendencies while maintaining a structured, comparative framework. By employing the
MFQ-2, a tool extensively validated in psychological research, we aim to provide a rigorous
and empirically grounded methodology for examining the moral reasoning capabilities
of artificial intelligence systems relative to human cognitive and ethical frameworks. The
synthetic sampling strategy enables us to explore the consistency and variability of model
responses, accounting for potential stochastic variations inherent in LLMs. Each sample
represents an independent prompt-response iteration, allowing us to assess the reliability
and reproducibility of moral reasoning across different model configurations and cultural
contexts.

3.2 Language Models Selection

We utilize a diverse range of open-weight LLMs with parameter sizes from 7B to 123B,
ensuring accessibility for researchers with moderate computational resources (approximately
80GB VRAM). We restrict our experiments to these open-weight and comparatively small
models, allowing easier reproducibility. Leaving out models from OpenAI or Anthropic is a
limitation. However, the goal of this study is not to analyze which LLMs are benchmark-
leading but to analyze the general capabilities of LLMs to align to psychological constructs by
examining their behavior. Thus, we analyze three open-weight state-of-the-art models: Llama
3.1 8B/70B [dubey2024llama], Mistral 7B/123B [jiang2023mistral7b], and Qwen 2.5
7B/72B [yang2024qwen2]. These models represent different geographic origins—Llama
from the United States (Meta), Mistral from Europe, and Qwen from China—allowing
potential detection of cultural variation in construct representation. We compare small
and large versions of each model family to assess if the number of parameters improves
alignment with the correlation observed in the human data. We compared small and
large versions within each model family to assess whether parameter count correlates
with improved alignment to human response patterns. During testing, we utilized default
hyperparameter configurations (temperature, repetition penalties) to reflect typical conditions
in naive application. This diversity enables us to test how discourses may differ between
these LLMs and potentially reveal insights into their intrinsic biases [abid2021persistent;

rozado2023political] resulting from training data selection and alignment processes.
Furthermore, we compare small and large versions of each model family to assess if the
number of parameters improves cultural understanding and diverse representation.

Cultural Persona Prompting We intend to assess synthetic surveys and evaluate the
alignment between participants and language models. Thus, we opt for a simple prompt
containing only the task and an optional persona stating the distinct cultural contexts. With
the reduction to the keywords of the geographical origin, we force the system to tap into its
built-in concepts [wei2021finetuned] without modifying them heavily in-context and thus,
introducing our observation biases [bostrom2013anthropic].

3.3 Analysis Methods

We analyze the intra-group variance across moral dimensions, individual questions,
and model/persona combinations to evaluate how consistently the LLMs perform
[munker2024towards]. Further, we employ Analysis of variance (ANOVA). We utilize
ANOVA to assess the significance of persona-specific adaptations. By decomposing response
variance into within-group and between-group components, we quantify the statistical
significance of modifications induced by prompting. The technique allows for a multilayered
exploration of response heterogeneity, enabling us to distinguish between mere statistical
artifacts and genuine, prompting-induced behavioral differentiations.

4 Results

The application of the MFQ-2 across multiple LLMs and cultural contexts reveals notable
patterns in how these models represent diverse moral frameworks compared to human
responses. Figure 1 illustrates the comparative distribution of moral foundation dimensions
across human responses, Llama 3.1 8B, and Mistral 7B, with data points representing
different country perspectives.

4.1

Initial Interpretation

The graphical representation of the MFQ-2 responses reveals distinct patterns across the
six moral dimensions. Human responses (Fig. 1, left panel) demonstrate substantial cross-
cultural variability, particularly in the authority, loyalty, and purity constructs. This variation
aligns with established findings in moral psychology research [atari2023morality]. In
contrast, both select LLMs exhibit compressed variance across cultural perspectives. Llama
3.1 8B (Fig. 1, center panel) demonstrates a tendency toward mean-regressing responses,

particularly under-representing the extremes observed in human data. The model shows
limited differentiation between cultural contexts on the authority and loyalty dimensions,
where human responses exhibit the most significant cross-cultural variance. Mistral 7B
(Fig. 1, right panel) shows a different pattern of limitations. While it displays broader
cross-cultural variation across all dimensions compared to Llama 3.1 8B, the overall
distribution is systematically offset from human responses, suggesting a consistent bias
across all cultural prompts regardless of origin.

4.2 Human-LLM Alignment Analysis

Examining the mean absolute difference between human and LLM responses across the
19 cultural contexts reveals systematic patterns in model performance (Tab. 1). The data
shows substantial variation in how accurately different models represent diverse cultural
perspectives:

Model-level performance Qwen2.5 7B demonstrates the highest overall alignment with
human responses (mean 𝑚𝑑 = 0.817), with several country representations achieving
high alignment scores (𝑚𝑑 ≤ 0.5). Mistral:123B shows the second-best performance
(𝑚𝑑 = 1.036), while Mistral 7B exhibits the poorest alignment overall (𝑚𝑑 = 3.487).

Cultural representation patterns The LLMs show varying degrees of alignment across
different cultural contexts. European perspectives — such as Belgium with multiple models
showing 𝑚𝑑 < 1.0 – are generally well-represented. However, we observe inconsistent
patterns in model alignment with non-Western perspectives. Some models represent South
African (𝑚𝑑 = 0.379 for Qwen2.5 7B) and Nigerian (𝑚𝑑 = 0.537 for Qwen2.5 72B)
perspectives with small distance while showing a significant deviation for others.

Parameter scaling effects Comparing small and large versions within model families
reveals inconsistent scaling benefits. While Mistral 123B (𝑚𝑑 = 1.036) significantly
outperforms Mistral 7B (𝑚𝑑 = 3.487), Qwen2.5 7B (𝑚𝑑 = 0.817) shows better alignment
than its larger counterpart Qwen2.5 72B (𝑚𝑑 = 1.143). It suggests that parameter count
alone does not guarantee improved cultural representation.

Notable outliers Japanese perspectives show consistently poor alignment across all models
(mean 𝑚𝑑 = 2.970), with Llama3.3 70B showing the highest deviation (𝑚𝑑 = 4.335). It
suggests particular challenges in representing East Asian moral frameworks.

4.3 ANOVA Analysis

To assess whether LLMs produce statistically distinct response distributions when prompted
with different cultural personas, we conducted an ANOVA analysis on responses to individual
MFQ-2 items (Tab. 2). This analysis reveals critical limitations in the models’ ability to
differentiate between cultural contexts on a statistical significance level:

Limited persona differentiation The predominance of non-significant p-values across
most items and models indicates that responses generated with different cultural personas
are often statistically indistinguishable. It suggests that despite surface-level text variations,
the underlying moral frameworks represented by the models remain mostly consistent
regardless of the prompted cultural context.

Model-specific patterns Mistral 7B shows the least differentiation between personas, with
non-significant results (34 of 36 items). Conversely, Llama3.1 8B demonstrates somewhat
greater persona sensitivity, with significant differences (21 of 36 items), though still failing
to differentiate in most cases. In contrast, Qwen 2.5 7B has only a few non-significant results
(2 of 36 items).

Item-specific sensitivity Certain MFQ-2 items (such as items 4, 6, 11, 14, 34, 36) show
more consistent differentiation across models, suggesting that specific moral concepts may
be more distinctly represented across cultural contexts in these models.

Data quality issues The presence of Nan values for Llama3.3 70B on multiple items sug-
gests insufficient response variance to calculate ANOVA statistics, suggesting homogeneous
responses across different cultural prompts for this model.

The ANOVA results provide strong evidence that current LLMs, despite generating su-
perficially different text when prompted with different cultural personas, often fail to
produce statistically distinct response patterns that would reflect genuine differences in
moral frameworks. This homogenization effect undermines the validity of using these
models to represent diverse cultural perspectives in synthetic social science research.

5 Discussion

Our findings reveal significant limitations in the ability of current LLMs to represent
culturally diverse moral frameworks despite their performance on many language tasks.
These limitations have relevant implications for AI alignment, synthetic populations in
research, and the ethical deployment of LLMs across different cultural contexts.

Limitations in Cultural Representation Our findings raise questions about the validity
of using LLMs as synthetic populations in social science research. While previous work has
suggested that LLMs can accurately simulate human response distributions [argyle2023out],
our cross-cultural analysis reveals critical limitations to this approach. The observed ho-
mogenization effect means that synthetic populations generated by current LLMs may
systematically under-represent cultural diversity, potentially leading to misleading conclu-
sions in cross-cultural research. This limitation is particularly concerning given the growing
interest in using synthetic populations to overcome practical and ethical challenges in
human subjects research. Our findings suggest that researchers should exercise caution when
using LLM-generated synthetic populations, particularly for cross-cultural research or when

studying moral reasoning. Comprehensive validation against human baseline data should be
required before accepting synthetic populations as valid proxies for human participants.

Training Data and Alignment Biases The systematic pattern of better representation for
Western versus non-Western cultural contexts suggests potential biases in model training data
and alignment processes. This finding aligns with broader concerns about over-representing
Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) perspectives in AI
training data. The fact that increased model size did not consistently improve cultural
representation fidelity suggests that the limitation is not addressed by scaling. Rather more
deliberate efforts to ensure diverse cultural representation in training data and alignment
processes may be necessary. It might include targeted data collection from underrepresented
cultural contexts, culturally informed evaluation metrics, and the inclusion of diverse cultural
perspectives in alignment objectives.

The Challenge of Embodied Cognition Our findings provide empirical support for the
theoretical critique raised in the background section regarding the embodiment deficit in
LLMs. The difficulty these models demonstrate in representing culturally-specific moral
intuitions may reflect their fundamental disconnection from the embodied experiences that
shape human moral reasoning. Moral intuitions are not merely abstract principles but are
deeply connected to lived experiences, emotional responses, and cultural practices. Without
embodiment in the physical world, LLMs may be inherently limited in their ability to
represent the full richness of human moral cognition. This limitation suggests the need for
greater epistemological humility in deploying LLMs across cultural contexts. While these
models can generate text that superficially resembles human moral reasoning, our findings
indicate that they do not reliably capture the nuanced ways moral intuitions vary across
cultures. This disconnect between surface-level competence and deeper understanding
represents a fundamental challenge for AI alignment.

5.1

Implications for AI Alignment and Governance

For AI Alignment Research Our findings highlight the need for culturally-informed
alignment objectives. Current processes produce models that regress toward a mean
moral framework rather than representing diverse value systems. Alignment should not
be conceptualized as conformity to a single set of values but as the ability to represent
diverse moral frameworks. Cross-cultural evaluation metrics are essential, as models may
appear aligned when tested within dominant contexts while failing with alternative moral
frameworks. Targeted interventions in the alignment process, including diversifying training
data and developing culturally-informed metrics, may better preserve distinctive features of
different moral frameworks.

For AI Governance and Policy Further, our findings reveal risks in deploying AI
systems across cultural contexts without considering their limitations in representing diverse
moral frameworks. As AI increasingly mediates social processes, inability to accurately
represent diverse moral intuitions could harm non-dominant cultural groups. Cultural impact
assessments should be part of AI governance frameworks, with additional safeguards where
significant limitations exist. Meaningful diversity in AI development teams is not merely a
matter of fairness but a technical necessity for creating systems that adequately represent
diverse human values.

For Social Science Research For social scientists using LLMs as research tools, our
findings suggest both opportunities and limitations. These models provide a unique oppor-
tunity to study cross-cultural understanding challenges. Researchers should empirically
validate model-generated responses against human baseline data rather than assuming valid
synthetic populations. Integrating insights from moral psychology into AI development
could inform targeted approaches to addressing limitations in cultural representation.

6 Conclusion

Our study investigated the ability of current LLMs to represent diverse cultural moral
frameworks through the lens of MFQ-2. Our findings reveal notable limitations in how
these models represent cross-cultural moral diversity, with systematic tendencies toward
homogenization and better representation of Western compared to non-Western perspectives.
These limitations have significant implications for AI alignment research, highlighting
the challenges of creating systems that represent diverse human values rather than merely
averaging across them. They also raise important questions about the validity of using
LLM-generated synthetic populations in social science research, particularly for cross-
cultural investigations. At a theoretical level, our findings provide empirical support for
concerns about the embodiment deficit in LLMs. The difficulty these models demonstrate
in representing culturally-specific moral intuitions suggests that disembodied language
processing may be fundamentally limited in capturing the full richness of human moral
cognition.

Future research should explore potential approaches to addressing these limitations, includ-
ing more diverse training data, culturally-informed alignment objectives, and innovative
architectures that might better capture the embodied and contextual nature of human moral
reasoning. Additionally, researchers using LLMs as tools for social science should develop
robust validation protocols to assess the alignment between model-generated and human
responses for their specific research contexts. As AI systems continue to play increasingly
important roles in mediating social processes across cultural contexts, addressing these
limitations in cultural representation becomes not merely a technical challenge but an
ethical imperative. Genuine AI alignment requires systems that can appropriately represent

and reason within diverse moral frameworks, respecting the full richness of human moral
diversity.

Limitations

The scope of our findings is constrained by the following methodological factors. First, our
experiment includes only a subset of available open-source LLMs, and results may differ
with other architectures or proprietary models. Second, our assessment of political alignment
relies exclusively on the MFQ-2, which, while validated in psychological research, represents
only one framework for measuring political orientation. Alternative instruments might yield
different insights or patterns of alignment. Third, our persona prompting technique employs
minimal ideological descriptors, and more elaborate prompting strategies might produce
different results. Fourth, our cross-cultural comparison was limited to Western and South
Korean populations, potentially overlooking important cultural nuances in moral reasoning
across other regions. Finally, the inherent limitations of LLMs — their lack of embodiment,
experiential learning, and authentic human socialization — fundamentally restrict their
ability to represent human moral and political reasoning processes.

Ethics Statement

This research was conducted in accordance with the ACM Code of Ethics. The raw results,
implementation details, and code-base are available upon request from the corresponding
author (muenker@uni-trier.de). We acknowledge the ethical complexities of using AI to
simulate human political perspectives and have made efforts to interpret our findings with
appropriate caution, avoiding overstatement of LLMs’ capabilities to represent human
belief systems. We emphasize that our work should not be used to justify the replacement
of diverse human participants in social science research with AI-generated responses, as
our findings specifically highlight the limitations of such approaches. Furthermore, we
recognize the potential for misuse of persona-based LLM applications in political contexts
and advocate for continued critical examination of these technologies as they evolve.
