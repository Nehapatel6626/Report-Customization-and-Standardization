So God created mankind in his own image,
 in the image of God he created them;
 male and female he created them.  Genesis 1:27



Course Description:

A given in this life is that we all experience pain—physical and psychological.  In this course students will explore the particular sources of pain experienced by women in contemporary society.  We will seek together, first, an adequate theodicy for dealing with pain, and second, a deeper understanding of the complex presenting problems many women experience.  Then we will search out effective ways to help women manage painful events or circumstances in their lives, within the context of a truthful Christian theodicy. (MACO degree goals 2, 4, 5, 7, 8)



Course Objectives:

At the end of this course students should be able to—

		Discuss sensitively the problem areas women deal within contemporary society;

		Articulate a theodicy and an approach to ministering to women in pain;

		Minister effectively as a counselor or pastor to women dealing with these problems;

		Help others develop sensitivity to these complex areas, which are often without simple solutions.



Instructional Methods:

Instructional methods will include lecture, guided discussion, small group discussion, case discussion, and student presentation.

In addition, once you've determined the topic of your research for this course, you will read at least 300 pages on that subject for your class presentation and case study, using published resources (not websites).



Requirements:

Students are expected to attend all classes and to participate actively. Students will discuss all absences with the instructor. Students will complete all assignments ON TIME. If life intervenes to prevent you from turning in an assignment on time, I will honor your prioritization of your life over schoolwork and the grade penalty is 1 point per day including weekends with no late assignment accepted more than 1 week late. Walker Percy said, “You can get straight A’s and flunk life.” Choose life and incur the grade penalty.



Assignments:

10 points each for 4 critical essays (= 40 points total)

30 points for a case study and model of intervention with an annotated bibliography

30 points for the oral presentation

		

Assigned Papers and Presentation:

Students will write four short (1-2 pages) reflection essays and one longer case study and model of intervention (10 pages plus annotated bibliography).  All papers must be typed and double-spaced.  

	Four Short Reflection Essays: Students will turn in FOUR short (1-2 pages) reflective essays reflecting on a book (or two books) from EACH topic area: Theodicy, Sex Differences, Women Worldwide, and Pain Management. In these essays students will discuss how the readings fit into their growing body of knowledge and understanding. Do not merely tell me what each author wrote. I have already read the books! Explore the significance of the readings as they affect your own thinking and ministry to women in pain. Use at least 10 of the following reflective / descriptive verbs like “I think,” “I wonder,” “I consider,” “I am confused by,” “I am touched by,” “My thinking is transformed by,” “I do not believe,” “I agree with,” “I disagree with,” “X caught my attention,” “X struck me.” An essay is NOT a research paper objectively laying out data with footnotes, etc.  Instead, these are short (1-2 pages) reflective essays exploring the assigned readings and reflecting on them as you grow in your awareness of the issues for women dealing with pain. An essay does not rely on citations of outside sources, but is personal and reflective. 



	The case study and model of intervention with annotated bibliography:  At the end of the first class session, students will choose an area of interest and will write about this topic. The paper must be typed and double-spaced. It should be no less than 8 pages and no more than 10 pages in length, NOT including the required annotated bibliography and any appendices you add. Students must include at least 5 sources in their bibliography. These sources must NOT be websites but published resources. Peer-reviewed journal articles and other recent publications represent the best resources. Students may use any standard thesis format (APA, Chicago Manual of Style, Turabian, etc.), but need to be consistent in their application of a standard format. MACO students must use APA style. Reference all your claims.



	A case study is the collection and presentation of detailed information about a particular person or small group, frequently including the accounts of subjects themselves. 1) Write a case study about a woman (who could be you!) dealing with the area of pain you selected during the first class and how you ministered to her or how you were ministered to. 2) Look back and reflect on what you could have done differently or what you would have liked to have been done differently. 3) Then offer a well-developed and well-researched model for intervening with a woman suffering that type of pain. 4) Include an annotated bibliography. A bibliographic annotation is a short paragraph telling the reader what was valuable (or not valuable) in the books / articles you read. For the case study, the following should be included.

Describe how the minister handled the situation.

Be objective.  Don’t try to make yourself “look good,” but present the situation as it unfolded for you. Use “I” statements in referring to yourself, and give other people in the case fictitious names using first names only (e.g., “Sally”), which will make the case less complicated to follow.

Do not attempt to give a psychological analysis or diagnosis unless you are sure of what you are talking about. Just present the case as it unfolded.

Provide background information that will help to understand the history of the situation and any relevant facts. Make the time-line clear, and describe significant movements or turning points in the situation.

What resources, if any, did you utilize?

Reflect on the case in hindsight. Are there things you would do differently or would like to have been done differently in light of what happened?

Describe a well-developed well-researched model for an optimum response to a woman dealing with this type of pain. “Well-researched” means that you will cite research that supports your model.

Include an annotated bibliography with an evaluation of each resource.

This paper is due at the time of your presentation. (See allocation of points below.)

	The 20-minute class presentation:  Research and present a 20-minute teaching session to the class.

The presentation must include a 1) devotional related to the material, 2) a clear definition of the problem, 3) the extent (or incidence) of the problem, 4) why the problem is painful, 5) suggested interventions (the model from your paper), and 6) a handout with at least 5 sources of information.
