Introduction

Sadie Roosa - Collections Strategist for 
Repository Services at MIT

DSpace@MIT - custom DSpace 6.3 app, hosted 
by Atmire
IRUS set up in October 2023 

Overview

• Why we chose to set up IRUS
• Benefits and potential benefits of IRUS
• How we are using IRUS so far
• Challenges with usage stats

Open scholcomm 
infrastructure
Libraries budget repurposed for open and 
equitable scholarship

Supporting open infrastructure, not just open 
content

Standard - COUNTER

Better align reporting on use of content in our 
repository with user of other libraries collections

Better align reporting on use of content in our 
repository with use of content in other (non-
DSpace) repositories

Demonstrating value

A more centralized, transparent place to show 
how much our repository is used and add to the 
story of how much repositories are used across 
the board
- Breakdowns by country of user
- Breakdowns by content type

Easy set up

● Easy to set up

a. DSpace 6 tracker code plug in (tracker code 
incorporated in codebase from DSpace 7 on)

b. Simple onboarding document with Lyrasis
c. Only took a few emails back and forth!

Potential benefits

● DOI and ORCID search promises a lot
a. a reason to work towards better ORCID 

integration in our repository

b. a reason to promote more folks to use IRUS so 

we can aggregate more stats on DOIs 
representing items deposited in multiple 
repositories

How we are using IRUS

So far just running reports manually for content 
types of interest and regular monthly/annual 
reporting

What can we use it to count?

● Monthly/yearly use since we set IRUS up

• Entire repository
• Specific content types

•

Individual items

● Most popular items in various categories for a set period 

of time

• Ex: Most popular thesis by total item requests in February 2024

What can’t we use it to count?

● All time numbers

• Especially for individual items, most authors, 
librarians, and users are interested in total 
download count

● Our repository has been around since 2002 and 
there are 130,000+ items that have previous 
downloads not counted in IRUS

Reporting on subsets

● Our repository isn’t organized by content types 

and not everything has a content type 

● We’ve historically reported along collection lines 

and we can’t do that in IRUS

a. Do we do both?
b. Do we shift what we’re reporting on?
